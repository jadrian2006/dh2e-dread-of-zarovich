Four centuries ago, Lord-Governor Strahd von Zarovich was the most decorated Imperial commander in the subsector — a brilliant strategist who conquered this world for the Imperium through sheer tactical genius and ruthless efficiency. When the brother he loved was ordained as a Ministorum priest and wed the woman Strahd coveted, he bargained with a Daemon Prince of Slaanesh for immortality, murdered Sergei on his wedding night, and damned the entire world.\n\nHe appears as a tall, gaunt man in archaic officer's regalia — dress uniform of a pattern not worn for four hundred years, immaculately maintained. His features are noble but corpse-pale, cheekbones sharp as blades, eyes burning with cold warp-light that shifts between violet and pale gold. His voice is a deep, cultured baritone. He moves with the fluid precision of a master swordsman and the patience of something that has all the time in the world.\n\nAfter four centuries, Strahd is profoundly, dangerously BORED. He has read every book, mastered every skill, broken every soul on Barovus. The Acolytes are the first interesting thing to happen in decades. He will toy with them, test them, invite them to dinner, compliment their courage, and ultimately try to destroy everything they care about — not from malice, but because their suffering is the only thing that makes him feel alive.\n\nHe loves Tatyana/Ireena with the obsessive, possessive love of a collector for a masterwork. Every generation she reincarnates, and every generation she dies before he can claim her. This is his curse, and he refuses to accept it.",

Ismark served three years in the planetary defence militia — close enough to Imperial Guard training to make him a competent fighter, far enough from real war to leave him unprepared for what Barovus has become.\n\nHe is broad-shouldered and solid, with the calloused hands of a man who works the land when he isn't fighting. His face is open and honest — a terrible quality on Barovus. He wears battered flak armour and carries a chainsword he maintains with religious devotion.\n\nIsmark is practical, brave, and deeply protective of Ireena — sometimes to a self-destructive degree. He will fight to the death to protect her without hesitation. He is not reckless, but he is not clever either; he follows orders well and fights steadily, but complex plans confuse him.
