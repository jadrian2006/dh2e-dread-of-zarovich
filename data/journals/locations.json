Perhaps two hundred souls cling to existence here in hab-blocks of local grey stone, huddled together as if for warmth that never comes. The buildings lean against one another like drunks, their rockcrete foundations cracked, their windows shuttered and dark. The streets are unpaved mud, rutted by cart tracks and pooled with standing water that reflects a sky the colour of a bruise. Nothing moves. Nothing speaks. But you are watched — you feel it in the prickling of your skin, in the way the shutters on every window are cracked just enough for a pair of eyes. The village is not empty. It is <em>terrified.</em></p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Facts</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Property</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Act</td><td>Act I — Descent into the Rift</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Map Reference</td><td>Map 1 (40x30 settlement map)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Population / Status</td><td>~200 souls, feudal agri-settlement, terrified and dying under centuries of Strahd's rule</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Primary Threat</td><td>Psychological — crushed populace, nightly warp-creature assaults on the Burgomaster's manor, Doru the warp-thrall beneath the chapel</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Quest Hooks</td><td>Burgomaster's funeral, escort Ireena to Fortress Vallak, investigate the chapel basement (Doru), meet the Vostra scouts, receive Strahd's letter</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>The First Settlement</h2>\n<p>The Village of Barovus is the Acolytes' first encounter with civilisation on the surface of this cursed world. After the harrowing crash of the Vessel of Lament and the disorienting march through warp-fog, the village emerges from the grey like a half-remembered nightmare of Imperial order gone to rot. It is a place where the Aquila still stands above the chapel door, but its wings are tarnished and its meaning has been hollowed out by three centuries of isolation and despair.</p>\n<p>The village serves a critical narrative function: it grounds the Acolytes in the reality of Barovus. The Vessel of Lament was a contained horror — a dungeon with walls. The village is an open wound, a community of real people who have lived under Strahd's dominion for generations and been broken by it. Every interaction here should reinforce the campaign's central themes: the erosion of faith, the corruption of authority, and the terrible cost of isolation from the Emperor's light. The villagers are not enemies — they are victims, and the Acolytes' response to their suffering will define the moral tone of the entire campaign.</p>\n<p>Mechanically, the village is a resupply point (limited), a social hub, and the launching point for the escort mission to Fortress Vallak that drives Act II. The Acolytes should leave Barovus with Ireena in tow, the weight of Strahd's letter in their pockets, and the grim understanding that the Lord-Governor knows exactly where they are and what they intend to do about it.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Village Layout</h2>\n<p>The village is arranged around a central muddy square with four key structures and roughly twenty hab-blocks of grey stone housing the terrified populace. Roads lead north toward the Zarovich Spire and west toward Fortress Vallak. Ancient vox-casters mounted on poles throughout the village crackle to life at irregular intervals, broadcasting proclamations from Strahd. Half-functional propaganda servitors patrol the streets in pairs, their vox-grilles broadcasting loyalty oaths and their ocular sensors recording everything.</p>\n\n<h3>The Burgomaster's Manor</h3>\n<p><strong>The Burgomaster's Manor</strong> is a two-storey stone structure that was once the finest building in the village. Its windows are boarded. Its doors are barricaded from the inside. Claw marks — deep, deliberate, and far too large to be human — score the exterior walls. The front garden is dead, and the iron fence that surrounds the property is bent inward in several places, as though something tried very hard to get in.</p>\n<p>Inside, the manor is dim and claustrophobic, every window blocked, every entrance reinforced with furniture and scrap metal. The Burgomaster's body lies in an upper room, and <strong>Ireena Kolyana</strong> will not open the door unless <strong>Ismark</strong> vouches for the Acolytes. The barricades show weeks of desperate, improvised reinforcement — testament to the nightly assaults by Strahd's creatures that ultimately killed Kolyan Indirovich through sheer accumulated terror.</p>\n\n<h3>The Chapel of the God-Emperor</h3>\n<p><strong>The Chapel</strong> is the only building the villagers maintain, though \"maintain\" is generous — the roof leaks, the pews are cracked, and the devotional murals have faded to ghosts. It is structurally sound and spiritually significant. A faint aura of sanctity clings to it, the last ember of faith in a world drowning in despair.</p>\n<p><strong>Father Donavich</strong> tends the chapel. He is a broken man — robes filthy, eyes red-rimmed and unfocused, hands trembling. Beneath the chapel floor, accessible by a trap door behind the altar, is the basement where his son <strong>Doru</strong> is chained. The sounds of scratching and a distorted voice moaning <em>\"Father...\"</em> can be heard during quiet moments, particularly during the funeral rites. The basement is a small root cellar reeking of warp corruption and human waste — and in the far corner, illuminated by a single sputtering candle, crouches what remains of a boy who wanted to be a hero.</p>\n\n<h3>The Blood of the Vein</h3>\n<p><strong>The Blood of the Vein</strong> is the village tavern. Its interior is dim, its ale is thin, and its proprietor — <strong>Arik</strong> — serves drinks with the mechanical emptiness of a servitor. He responds to direct questions with monosyllables and stares at nothing. Three <strong>Vostra</strong> travellers sit in the corner: <strong>Ratka</strong>, <strong>Sorva</strong>, and <strong>Emilian</strong> — scouts from Madam Eva's camp, colourfully dressed, adorned with charms and fetishes, and utterly unconcerned by the gloom. They will offer cryptic warnings and directions to the Vostra camp if approached.</p>\n\n<h3>Bildrath's General Store</h3>\n<p><strong>Bildrath's Provisions</strong> is run by <strong>Bildrath</strong>, a bitter, suspicious man who sells basic supplies at extortionate prices (300% markup). His stock is pathetic — a few candles, some rope, dried rations of uncertain provenance, and a single battered lasgun power pack. He has a massive, silent bodyguard named <strong>Parriwimple</strong> (Ogryn ancestry, clearly) who stands behind the counter and stares.</p>\n\n<h3>Village Square</h3>\n<p>The central square is little more than a patch of churned mud where the roads converge. The vox-casters are loudest here, and the propaganda servitors make regular circuits. This is where the funeral procession passes and where Strahd's servitor delivers his letter of welcome. At night, the square is deserted — every villager bolts their doors before dark, and nothing the Acolytes say will convince them otherwise.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key NPCs</h2>\n\n<h3>Ismark Kolyanovich</h3>\n<p><strong>Ismark</strong> finds the Acolytes shortly after their arrival. He is a tall, broad-shouldered man in his early thirties, wearing the battered remnants of an Imperial Guard uniform (Barovian 12th Infantry — a regiment that existed three centuries ago). He carries a chainsword — old, well-maintained, clearly cherished — and moves with a soldier's discipline. His eyes are haunted.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Honest, brave, and deeply frightened. Desperate for help but not pathetic — he carries himself with the bearing of a soldier who knows the odds and fights anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Protect his sister Ireena. Get her to Fortress Vallak, where walls and a garrison might slow Strahd's pursuit. He cannot do this alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Dialogue:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>\"You are offworlders. I can see it — the way you walk, the way you <em>look</em> at things, like you expect the world to make sense. It doesn't. Not here. Not for a long time.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"My father was the Burgomaster. He is dead. Strahd's creatures killed him — not with claws, but with fear. Weeks of it. They came every night, howling and scratching, and my father stood at the door with his pistol and his prayers, and each night he aged a year.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Social Tests:</strong> Responds well to honest, direct communication. <em>Charm (Ordinary +10)</em> or <em>Command (Routine +20)</em> earns his trust and full cooperation. <em>Intimidation</em> makes him defensive but compliant — he is too desperate to refuse help.</p>\n\n<h3>Ireena Kolyana</h3>\n<p><strong>Ireena</strong> is inside the Burgomaster's manor, behind the barricades. She is mid-twenties, dark hair, pale angular face, striking violet eyes that shift and shimmer. She wears a worn bodyglove under a heavy coat and carries a laspistol with recent-use familiarity. Two circular, puckered wounds mar the skin of her throat — Strahd's bite marks, radiating faint psychic energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Frightened but fierce. She will not suffer pity or condescension.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Bury her father with proper rites before leaving. She refuses to depart until the funeral is complete.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Dialogue:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>\"If you have come to gawk at the Lord-Governor's prey, you may leave. If you have come to help, then help. My father needs to be buried before nightfall.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Secret:</strong> She is an emerging psyker — untrained, unregistered — experiencing objects moving when emotional, candle flames bending toward her, whispers others do not hear. A <em>Psyniscience Test (Challenging +0)</em> reveals her latent ability. She has told no one.</p>\n\n<h3>Father Donavich</h3>\n<p><strong>Father Donavich</strong> performs the Burgomaster's funeral rites in a hollow monotone. He is a broken man — filthy robes, red-rimmed unfocused eyes, trembling hands. His faith is shattered by the horror chained beneath his own chapel.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> He prays constantly over his mutated son Doru, hoping for a cure that will never come. He will resist any attempt to enter the basement but can be convinced with compassion.</p>\n\n<h3>Doru</h3>\n<p><strong>Doru</strong> is Donavich's son, chained in the chapel basement. He led a doomed assault on the Zarovich Spire months ago. Strahd slaughtered the attackers and sent Doru back <em>changed</em> — a warp-touched mutant with limbs too long, joints bending wrong, skin the colour of a bruise. His eyes remain human and aware and begging.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Dialogue:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Kill me. Please. Emperor. Kill me.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Combat Profile:</strong> Use Mutant profile (DH core), <em>Fear Rating 1</em>, plus <em>Regeneration (1)</em>, <em>Unnatural Strength x2</em>, and a psychic despair aura (all within 10m must pass <em>Willpower, Challenging +0</em>, or suffer -10 to all tests for 1d5 rounds). Killing him is an act of mercy.</p>\n\n<h3>Minor NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>Arik</strong> (barkeep) — hollow-eyed, monosyllabic, severe long-term psychological trauma. Functional but barely present.</p>\n<p><strong>Bildrath</strong> (merchant) — bitter, suspicious, 300% markup. Accompanied by <strong>Parriwimple</strong>, his Ogryn-ancestry bodyguard.</p>\n<p><strong>Ratka, Sorva, Emilian</strong> (Vostra scouts) — colourful, warp-touched traders in the tavern. Offer cryptic warnings: <em>\"The Lord of the Spire sees all, but he is blind to what the cards reveal.\"</em> They provide directions to the Vostra camp.</p>\n\n<h2>Encounters</h2>\n<p><strong>The Funeral Procession:</strong> Carrying the Burgomaster's body from the manor to the chapel. No villagers will assist — the Acolytes and Ismark must bear the coffin themselves. The procession is sombre and exposed. Strahd may observe from the fog but does not intervene.</p>\n<p><strong>Strahd's Letter:</strong> A lone, elegant servitor in formal livery approaches the most senior-looking Acolyte, extending a silver tray bearing a sealed envelope with an ornate \"S\" pressed into black wax. The letter is civil, warm, and absolutely menacing — Strahd knows their names, their mission, their location, and their connection to Ireena.</p>\n<p><strong>Nightly Assaults (if the Acolytes remain after dark):</strong> Warp-hounds and servitor-soldiers probe the manor's defences. These are not full combat encounters but atmospheric events — howling, scratching, shapes in the fog — designed to demonstrate why Kolyan Indirovich died of fear.</p>"

His influence manifests through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vox-caster broadcasts:</strong> Smooth, cultured voice delivering proclamations, tithe reminders, curfew warnings, and personal messages designed to torment specific villagers.</li>\n<li><strong>Propaganda servitors:</strong> Shambling pairs broadcasting loyalty oaths and recording everything with ocular sensors. Not combat-capable but serve as Strahd's eyes and ears.</li>\n<li><strong>The letter:</strong> Delivered at a dramatically appropriate moment. Demonstrates total awareness of the Acolytes' identities, mission, and connection to Ireena.</li>\n<li><strong>First direct encounter:</strong> Triggered at the GM's discretion (on the road, during the funeral, leaving the Vostra camp, or during the first night). This is a narrative encounter — Strahd cannot be defeated. Any attack is effortlessly deflected. He demonstrates absolute power, expresses delighted interest, and departs on his own terms.</li>\n<li><strong>Nightly probing:</strong> If Acolytes stay in the village, warp-creatures test the manor's defences after dark — atmospheric, not mechanical combat.</li>\n</ul>"

Trophy cases display six-legged Barovian predators in cracked stasis jars. <strong>Portraits</strong> line both walls — formal Durst family pict-captures that <em>change</em> when not directly observed (faces rot, smiles widen to rictus grins). <em>Willpower (Ordinary +10)</em> on first noticing; failure: 1 <em>Insanity Point</em>. Slaaneshi corruption detectable with <em>Forbidden Lore (Chaos), Challenging +0</em>.</p>\n\n<h3>UD2 — Officer's Mess [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>A long table set for a meal that appears freshly prepared — but watching it causes the food to rot in real time.

Data-slate racks and bookshelves fill every wall. <em>Search (Ordinary +10)</em> reveals <strong>Captain Gustav Durst's journal</strong> behind a false bulkhead — documenting the crew's 15-year descent into Slaaneshi heresy, the rituals, and the children's deaths (\"We forgot them\"). Reading in full: <strong>1d5 Insanity Points, 1 Corruption Point</strong>, but grants +20 to subsequent <em>Forbidden Lore (Chaos)</em> tests on the vessel.

Clean air, warm like remembered sunlight. The Astropath's skeleton sits in peaceful meditation. <strong>Sanctuary Effect:</strong> 10 minutes rest removes 1 <em>Insanity Point</em> (once per Acolyte). <strong>Psychic Echo</strong> (<em>Psyniscience, Challenging +0</em>): fragmentary message — <em>\"the children are the key... the entity fears what it consumed... the altar is the chain\"</em> — speaking the children's names during the boss fight grants +10 to <em>Willpower Tests</em>. <strong>Sending-Stone:</strong> grants +20 to attacks against the altar-engine; disrupts Phase 2 effects; crumbles after use.</p>\n\n<h2>Mid Deck (8 Rooms)</h2>\n\n<h3>MD1 — Captain's Private Chambers [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>Oppressively lavish — silks, perfumes, mirrors covering every surface. Mirrors show the compartment in its prime, populated by beautiful figures who are <em>watching the Acolytes</em>. <em>Awareness (Ordinary +10)</em> to notice; <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> or 1 IP. Locked jewellery box (<em>Security, Ordinary +10</em>): cameo locket of Elisabeth Durst, precious stones (~200 Thrones).</p>\n\n<h3>MD2 — The Children's Cabin [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>Two small beds, children's drawings, toy box. Freezing cold — breath mists. If Acolytes linger, Rose and Thorn manifest on their beds. Rose recounts their death: sealed in by parents who never returned. <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> or <strong>1d5 Insanity Points</strong>. The children beg the Acolytes to destroy the monster below \"so we can sleep.\"</p>\n\n<h3>MD3 — Hidden Shrine [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Concealed hatch (<em>Search, Difficult -10</em>, or <em>Awareness, Hard -20</em>). Eight-pointed star inlaid in the deck, black tallow candles, blood-and-obscura offerings. <strong>1 Corruption Point</strong> on entry (automatic), +1 CP per 10 additional minutes. Palpable Slaaneshi aura (auto-detect with <em>Psyniscience</em>).</p>\n\n<h3>MD4 — Sealed Storage Bay [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>Contains <strong>Elisabeth Durst's</strong> preserved corpse and her sealed letter confessing to the family's damnation, the entity fused to the warp drive, and the children's fate. The letter inflicts <strong>1 Insanity Point</strong> and provides critical context. <em>Logic or Scholastic Lore (Occult), Ordinary +10</em> to piece together the full picture.</p>\n\n<h3>MD5 — Medicae Bay [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Warp-echo of Elisabeth Durst performing ritual vivisection plays automatically: <strong>1 Insanity Point</strong> (no save). <em>Search (Ordinary +10)</em>: 2 doses of de-tox, 1 stimm. <strong>Mimic-Cabinet Trap:</strong> fleshy tendrils grapple (Strength 40, 1d10+2 R/round, 12 Wounds, vulnerable to fire). Detect: <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em>.</p>\n\n<h3>MD6 — Crew Quarters (Main) [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p><strong>Vasily Hent's journal</strong> in a foot-locker: grants +10 to <em>Fellowship Tests</em> with ghost-children, and reveals power conduit sequence (red-blue-green) for MD7. <strong>Sleeping Gas Trap:</strong> pressure plate releases soporific gas; <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> or 2 levels of Fatigue. Detect: <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em>; disarm: <em>Security (Ordinary +10)</em>.</p>\n\n<h3>MD7 — Enginarium Access Corridor [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Alternative route to lower decks. Complete darkness. <strong>Power Routing Puzzle:</strong> red-blue-green sequence restores lower deck lumens (removes darkness penalties, boss loses concealment attacks). Wrong sequence (1st): 1d10 E damage to all in corridor. Wrong (2nd): permanent failure, mid deck lighting becomes intermittent.</p>\n\n<h3>MD8 — Cargo Hold [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Slaaneshi tribute cache: silk, perfume, jewellery, ~200 Thrones. Taking items: <strong>1 Corruption Point/day</strong> while carried; <em>Willpower (Ordinary +10)</em> daily to voluntarily discard. <strong>Sanctified Incense Censer</strong> (hidden in corner): 3 charges, each creates 5m radius sanctified zone for 10 minutes (+10 to <em>Willpower Tests</em> vs. warp phenomena, fear, psychic attacks). Significant find.</p>\n\n<h2>Lower Deck — Engineering (7 Rooms)</h2>\n<p><strong>Descent:</strong> Hidden behind data-slate rack in captain's quarters (<em>Search, Challenging +0</em>). Service ladder into absolute darkness. The vessel transitions from machine to living organism — bulkheads glisten with flesh-warmth, ladder rungs are slick with copper-and-perfume moisture. <strong>All Acolytes gain 1 Corruption Point</strong> upon entering the lower decks.</p>\n\n<h3>LD1 — The Brig [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>Corridor lined with brig cells. Two cells still hold skeletal remains showing ritual mutilation (<em>Medicae, Ordinary +10</em> to identify Slaaneshi practices). <strong>1 Insanity Point</strong> for close examination.</p>\n\n<h3>LD2 — Engineering Antechamber [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>Metal benches, a lectern with a Chaos liturgy book. Reading the book: <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> to put it down; reading more than a few pages: <strong>1d10 Insanity Points, 1d5 Corruption Points</strong>. With <em>Forbidden Lore (Chaos)</em>: safe skim (1 CP only), learn the cult summoned a daemon bound to the warp drive.</p>\n\n<h3>LD3 — The Warp Drive Chamber [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>The boss arena. Cathedral-vaulted engineering bay with bone-and-metal mosaic forming an eight-pointed star. The corrupted altar-engine — fused bone, black iron, engine components — pulses at the centre. See <strong>Boss Fight</strong> page for full encounter details.</p>\n\n<h3>LD4 — Congregation Hall [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Warp-expanded cathedral space (4x the volume the ship's schematics allow). Bone-and-metal pews, murals depicting the Durst family's fall in five panels. 1d5+2 warp-echo worshippers (non-hostile, can be dispersed by prayer or sanctified items). Studying murals: <strong>1 Corruption Point</strong>. Peaceful dispersal of all echoes: each Acolyte regains 1 Fatigue.</p>\n\n<h3>LD5 — Sacrificial Preparation Chamber [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Charnel house — blood-layered bulkheads, restraint slab, instrument rack, clogged drain. Enter: <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or <strong>1d5 Insanity Points</strong>. <strong>Ritual Knife:</strong> Best-Quality knife (+5 damage), but 1 CP/day carried and <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> to put down; glows near warp entities. <strong>Victim's Escape Map:</strong> scratched under slab — automatic Navigate success in lower decks, marks LD6. <strong>Pit Trap:</strong> drainage grate collapses; <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> to detect; 1d10 I damage, <em>Agility (Challenging +0)</em> to climb out.</p>\n\n<h3>LD6 — Engine Crawlspace [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Flanking route to LD3. Narrow, dark, hot (1d5 E per 10 minutes without protection). Navigation: victim's map = auto-success, or <em>Navigate (Surface), Challenging +0</em>. All combat at -20 WS/BS, no two-handed weapons. <strong>Tactical Reward:</strong> emerging behind the altar-engine grants a surprise round with +20 to hit on the first round.</p>\n\n<h3>LD7 — Heart of the Vessel (Hidden Chamber) [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Concealed behind a bulkhead panel visible only after the altar-engine is destroyed/damaged. Clean, cold, intact — preserved by residual Gellar field. <strong>Gellar Field Modulator:</strong> single-use, creates 10m warp-ward for 8 hours (+20 to <em>Corruption Tests</em>, warp-touched at -10 to all Characteristics). Extraordinarily valuable for Barovus. <strong>Stasis Pod:</strong> contains <strong>Vasily Hent</strong> (Enginseer's Mate), alive after 200 years. <em>Tech-Use (Ordinary +10)</em> to revive. Potential NPC ally or replacement character. Gains 2d10 IP on revival; <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or breakdown for 1d10 rounds.</p>"

They appear as living, breathing children, not obviously spectral.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Terrified, desperate, pitiable. They are not malicious but are compelled by the ship's lure to draw victims deeper inside.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection:</strong> <em>Awareness (Hard -20)</em>: they cast no shadows, their breath produces no mist, their feet do not quite touch the deck plates. <em>Psyniscience (Challenging +0)</em>: warp-echoes, not true spirits.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Dialogue:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Please. There is a monster in our ship. In the lower decks. Our parents won't wake up. Please help us.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"We died here. Mother and Father sealed the hatch. They said it was to keep us safe from the monster. But they never came back. We waited. We were so hungry. Thorn cried. Then Thorn stopped crying. Then I stopped too.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mechanical Role:</strong> Speaking their names during the boss fight and calling on them to resist the entity grants all allies <strong>+10 to Willpower Tests</strong> for the remainder of the encounter. This clue is obtained from the Astropath's psychic echo (UD7). Vasily Hent's journal (MD6) also provides +10 to <em>Fellowship Tests</em> with the children.</p>\n\n<h3>Vasily Hent (Stasis Survivor)</h3>\n<p><strong>Vasily</strong> is the ship's Enginseer's Mate, preserved in a stasis pod in the hidden chamber (LD7) for approximately 200 years. He sealed himself in when the cult's activities became undeniable.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Confused, terrified, but grateful. Deeply traumatised (gains 2d10 IP on revival). Requires time and kindness to become functional.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Tech-Use (basic), Trade (Armourer) — useful for equipment maintenance on Barovus.</p>\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> Potential NPC ally for the campaign or replacement character hook if an Acolyte died during the dungeon. Source of historical information about the vessel and the cult's early formation.</p>\n\n<h2>Enemy Encounters</h2>\n\n<h3>Warp-Echo Cultists (Phase 2 Boss Fight)</h3>\n<p>1d5 translucent, flickering spectral figures that manifest from the bulkheads during Phase 2. Use Cultist profiles with half Wounds and the <em>Incorporeal</em> trait (immune to mundane weapons; force weapons, sanctified weapons, and psychic attacks deal normal damage). They dissolve permanently when destroyed.</p>\n\n<h3>Warp-Echo Worshippers (LD4 — Congregation Hall)</h3>\n<p>1d5+2 translucent specters frozen in rapturous worship. Non-hostile. Can be dispersed by prayer (1d5 per prayer), sanctified items (incense censer disperses all instantly), or violence (any attack disrupts one, but this feels profoundly wrong). Peaceful dispersal grants Fatigue recovery.</p>\n\n<h3>Environmental \"Enemies\"</h3>\n<p>The ship itself is the primary antagonist beyond the boss. Bulkheads seal behind the Acolytes. Corridors rearrange. The organic walls contract. Power conduits rupture. The mimic-cabinet in MD5. The sleeping gas trap in MD6. The pit trap in LD5. The ship's malign intelligence works to separate, disorient, and terrorise.</p>\n\n<h2>Social Encounters</h2>\n<p>There are no traditional social encounters aboard the Vessel of Lament — the ship is a dead place populated by echoes and a daemon. However, the ghost-children function as a pseudo-social encounter: they respond to kindness, can be comforted (though not saved until the entity is destroyed), and provide crucial information through their dialogue. The Acolytes' treatment of Rose and Thorn is an early moral test that sets the tone for the campaign's approach to compassion in horror.</p>"

This is the mechanism that delivers the Acolytes to the campaign's main setting.</li>\n<li><strong>Main Plot — The Children:</strong> Rose and Thorn's tragedy foreshadows the campaign's themes of innocence destroyed by corruption. Their spectral presence echoes Ireena's vulnerability and the cycle of suffering Strahd perpetuates.</li>\n<li><strong>Relics — Sending-Stone:</strong> A key tactical resource for the boss fight. The Astropath's psychic echo also provides the clue about invoking the children's names.</li>\n<li><strong>Campaign Resource — Gellar Field Modulator:</strong> The single-use warp-ward from LD7 is one of the most valuable items in the entire campaign for surviving on Barovus.</li>\n<li><strong>Campaign Resource — Navigation Data:</strong> The +10 Navigate bonus from the bridge cogitators persists for the entire campaign.</li>\n<li><strong>NPC — Vasily Hent:</strong> Potential long-term ally or replacement character. His technical skills are useful on a world with no Mechanicus support.</li>\n<li><strong>Completion Bonus:</strong> All surviving Acolytes gain 100 XP.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Strahd's Presence</h2>\n<p>Strahd is not directly present aboard the Vessel of Lament. However, his influence permeates the experience indirectly: the ship exists because of the warp anomaly that Strahd's pact created. The anomaly pulled the Acolytes' vessel into the system. The ghost-children, the Durst family's fall, and the entity in the warp drive are all consequences of the same Slaaneshi corruption that sustains Strahd's immortality. The GM should draw these connections subtly — Captain Durst's journal references \"the Lord-Governor\" and his \"pact with the powers beyond the veil,\" establishing Strahd's shadow even before the Acolytes set foot on Barovus.</p>"

Over centuries, it has fused with the engine itself, becoming a hybrid of daemon-flesh and machine — neither fully warp entity nor fully mechanism, but something worse than either. When it manifests, it tears itself free of the altar-engine in a spray of bone, ichor, and sparking power conduits.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The corridor opens into the main engineering bay — a vaulted chamber that should not exist on a vessel of this class — vast, cathedral-like, its ceiling lost in shadow and the tangle of power conduits and coolant pipes that have fused with organic matter. The deck is a mosaic of bone and dark metal, forming a massive eight-pointed star. At its centre, where the warp drive's core housing should be, stands a corrupted altar of fused bone, black iron, and engine components — the drive and the shrine have become one, stained with centuries of dried blood and machine oil turned to ichor. The altar-engine <em>pulses.</em> Something within it is aware of you.</p></blockquote>\n\n<h2>Entity Profile</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Value</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>WS</td><td>45</td></tr>\n<tr><td>BS</td><td>20</td></tr>\n<tr><td>S</td><td>45</td></tr>\n<tr><td>T</td><td>50</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Ag</td><td>40</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Int</td><td>30</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Per</td><td>40</td></tr>\n<tr><td>WP</td><td>55</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Fel</td><td>15</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wounds</td><td>30</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Armour</td><td>4 (All, unnatural flesh)</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Traits:</strong> <em>Daemonic</em> (TB 10 vs. non-blessed/non-force weapons), <em>Fear 2 (Frightening)</em>, <em>From Beyond</em>, <em>Strange Physiology</em>, <em>Warp Instability</em></p>\n<p><strong>Attacks:</strong> Bone-Lash Tendrils (Melee; 1d10+5 R; Pen 2; Flexible, Snare), Psychic Shriek (20m; WP Test or 1d10+3 E ignoring armour, plus 1 IP)</p>\n\n<h2>Phase 1 — The Awakening (100% to 50% Wounds)</h2>\n<p>The creature fights defensively, using tendrils to grapple and separate Acolytes. It shrieks when wounded, dealing psychic damage to all in range. It cannot leave the warp drive chamber. It prioritises isolating the most dangerous combatant and dragging them toward the altar-engine, where contact inflicts <strong>1d5 Corruption Points per round</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ship Turns Hostile:</strong> Once engaged, the vessel itself works against the Acolytes. Bulkhead hatches slam shut. Organic walls constrict corridors. Power conduits rupture. <em>Navigate (Surface) or Logic (Challenging +0)</em> required to find the way back once the fight begins.</p>\n\n<h2>Phase 2 — The Surge (50% to 25% Wounds)</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The creature <em>screams</em> — not in pain but in command. The altar-engine flares with sickly light, and the air itself splits open in a dozen places. Warp-light — raw, unfiltered Immaterium — floods the chamber in strobing pulses of pink and violet. The organic walls contract. The ceiling lowers. The room is shrinking around you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The following effects trigger simultaneously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warp-Light Surge:</strong> All Acolytes: <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> or Stunned 1 round. Psykers at -10 to this test.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultist Echoes:</strong> 1d5 warp-echo cultists manifest — Cultist profiles with half Wounds, <em>Incorporeal</em> trait. Immune to mundane weapons; vulnerable to force, sanctified, and psychic attacks. Dissolve permanently when destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Constricting Chamber:</strong> Organic walls contract for 3 rounds, shrinking ~1m per round. Acolytes at edges: <em>Agility (Ordinary +10)</em> each round or pushed inward and take 1d5 I damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Sending-Stone Disruption:</strong> If carried (from UD7), activate as a Half Action: cultist echoes dissolve, chamber stops constricting, entity takes <strong>2d10 E damage</strong> (ignoring armour). Stone crumbles to dust.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Phase 3 — The Fusion (25% to 0% Wounds)</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The creature no longer resembles anything that was ever alive. It has pulled itself into the altar-engine like a parasite burrowing into a wound, and the engine has responded — power conduits throb with black light, the bone-metal floor cracks and heaves, and the entire chamber vibrates with a frequency that makes your teeth ache and your vision blur. The entity has become the drive. The drive has become the entity. And both are <em>furious.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Escalation:</strong> All Characteristics gain +10. Armour increases to 6 (All). New attacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warp Vortex (Free Action, 1/round):</strong> Micro-rift strikes a random Acolyte: <strong>2d10 E, Pen 5</strong>. Target: <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or gain <strong>1d5 Corruption Points</strong>. The rift point can be attacked (5 Wounds, no armour) or disrupted by prayer (+10 to hit with sanctified weapons).</li>\n<li><strong>Collapsing Floor (start of each round):</strong> Random 2m x 2m section gives way. Acolytes on it: <em>Agility (Challenging +0)</em> or fall for <strong>2d10 E damage</strong>; <em>Strength (Ordinary +10)</em> to climb back up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Shared Health Pool:</strong> In Phase 3, the altar-engine and entity share a single health pool — damage to either affects both. This is the entity's most dangerous but most vulnerable state.</p>\n\n<h2>The Altar-Engine</h2>\n<p>The corrupted warp drive core has <strong>Armour 8</strong> and <strong>20 Wounds</strong>.

Black ichor and superheated plasma erupt from the fissure, and the creature fused with it <em>screams</em> — not with a voice but with the fabric of reality itself. The organic bulkheads shudder, contract, and begin to rot — centuries of decay happening in seconds. And then the ship <em>lurches.</em> The warp anomaly is pulling you through. Toward Barovus. And it is tearing itself apart.</p></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Escape Sequence (5 Rounds)</h3>\n<p>The Acolytes have <strong>5 rounds</strong> to reach a crash station or saviour pod on the upper decks.

The vessel plunges through the rift like a burning spear. The impact is the end of everything you knew. You crawl from the wreckage into grey fog so thick it has <em>texture</em> — it slides across your skin like damp silk, carrying a sweet, cloying scent of flowers rotting on a grave.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Acolytes emerge from the wreckage onto Barovus. <strong>All Acolytes gain 1 Corruption Point</strong> from exposure to the warp-fog (unavoidable). The road south leads to the Village of Barovus. <strong>All surviving Acolytes gain 100 XP</strong> for completing the Vessel of Lament.</p>"

The outermost ring is a commercial district of shuttered shops and empty market stalls. The middle ring contains hab-blocks packed with the bulk of the population. The inner ring houses the PDF barracks, the Ministorum chapel of Saint Andral, the administratum, and the modest estates of the surviving elite. The streets are patrolled by PDF soldiers in mismatched flak armour, their faces haggard and their trigger fingers twitchy.</p>\n<p>Propaganda posters cover every surface: \"SMILING IS LOYALTY,\" \"REPORT UNHAPPINESS,\" \"THE FOG CANNOT ENTER A JOYFUL HEART.\" These are not ironic. Burgomaster Vallakovich believes every word. The town's infrastructure is degraded but functional — a single promethium generator runs at 40% capacity, powering the gate servitors, cogitators, and vox-caster network. Running water is rationed. Food comes from small hydroponic gardens and irregular Vostra trade.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere is one of suffocating tension. Citizens report neighbours for insufficient enthusiasm. Children are drilled in patriotic songs. The mandatory festivals are grotesque spectacles of forced merriment under armed surveillance. And yet, for all its dysfunction, the walls hold, the gate closes at night, and the chapel of Saint Andral still radiates a faint aura of genuine sanctity. To destroy this place would condemn five hundred souls. To leave it as it is perpetuates a regime of fear. The Acolytes will find no easy answers here.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas of Fortress Vallak</h2>\n<h3>The Main Gate</h3>\n<p>A slab of plasteel wide enough for a Chimera to pass through, flanked by two functioning gun-servitors that track all approaches with mindless patience. The gate opens at dawn and seals at dusk without exception. A <strong>servitor-skull</strong> mounted above the gate records all arrivals. Entering requires either legitimate business (a <strong>Challenging (+0) Deceive</strong> or <strong>Fellowship</strong> Test to bluff past the gate guards) or Inquisitorial authority (which draws immediate attention from both Vallakovich and Wachter's spies). After dark, entry requires the Burgomaster's personal authorisation or a <strong>Hard (-20) Security</strong> Test to bypass the gate mechanisms.</p>\n<h3>Blue Water Inn</h3>\n<p>The closest thing to neutral ground in the settlement — a drinking establishment in the outer commercial ring run by the <strong>Martikov family</strong>. The interior is dim, warm, and perpetually hazy with lho-smoke. The bar serves watered-down amasec, thin gruel, and recaf of passable quality. Two floors: the common room below, rented hab-chambers above. A concealed back door leads into a narrow alley used by the Martikovs for discreet exits.</p>\n<p>The Inn functions as the settlement's unofficial information exchange. PDF soldiers on leave, Vostra traders, refugees, and those who need a moment's respite gather here. The Martikovs carefully curate the atmosphere — welcoming enough to loosen tongues, quiet enough that conversations stay private. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Inquiry</strong> Test at the Inn yields rumours about current events, and the Martikovs themselves can provide intelligence about Vallakovich, Wachter, and Van Richten's whereabouts (if the Acolytes earn their trust).</p>\n<h3>Wachterhaus</h3>\n<p>A faded noble estate in the inner ring, maintained with obsessive precision while the rest of the town crumbles. The ground floor is a receiving hall of polished wood and antique furnishings — portrait of the late Lord Wachter above the fireplace, amasec decanters always full, the faint scent of embalming fluid beneath perfume. The upper floors contain Lady Wachter's private chambers and a locked bedroom where she keeps her dead husband's preserved body, speaking to it nightly.</p>\n<p>The <strong>hidden cellar</strong> beneath the wine stores is the true threat. Accessed through a concealed hatch (<strong>Challenging (+0) Awareness</strong> Test to notice, or <strong>Hard (-20) Security</strong> Test to bypass the locks), it contains a crude shrine to Strahd surrounded by ritual implements, Chaos iconography masked as Imperial devotionals, and a collection of bound parchments containing Wachter's correspondence with Strahd's agents. Twelve chairs arranged in a circle — one for each member of <strong>The Devoted</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Chapel of Saint Andral</h3>\n<p>A modest Ministorum chapel in the inner ring, its walls thick stone, its stained-glass windows depicting the martyrdom of Saint Andral in faded colours. The interior is austere: wooden pews, a stone altar, an iron aquila mounted on the wall behind it. <strong>Father Lucian Petrovich</strong> tends the chapel alone.</p>\n<p>While the <strong>Bones of Saint Andral</strong> remain beneath the altar, the chapel and its immediate surroundings are <em>Sanctified Ground</em>: warp entities cannot enter, psychic powers are dampened (-10 to Focus Power Tests within 20m), and all Corruption Tests within the area gain a +10 bonus. The bones have been stolen — the reliquary beneath the altar is empty. Without the bones, the chapel's sanctity will fail within days, leaving it vulnerable to the warp-thralls hiding in the coffin-maker's shop.</p>\n<h3>Market Square</h3>\n<p>The central plaza of the outer ring, dominated by a raised wooden stage used for Vallakovich's mandatory festivals. Vox-casters on every lamp-post broadcast patriotic messages and tinny music on a loop. A massive effigy of the sun — scrap metal painted yellow — stands ready to be ignited at the next festival's climax. The square is ringed by shuttered shops: a pawnbroker (potential location for Dawn's Edge per the Tarot), a scrivener, a chandler, and a coffin-maker's shop operated by <strong>Henrik van der Voort</strong>.</p>\n<p>Henrik's shop is a two-storey building of grey stone. The ground floor displays coffins and funerary supplies. The upper storage area contains <strong>six warp-thralls</strong> hiding in packing crates, waiting for the chapel's sanctity to fail before launching their assault. Henrik himself is a terrified civilian coerced into this arrangement — he barely eats, barely sleeps, and flinches at every sound.</p>\n<h3>PDF Barracks</h3>\n<p>A squat rockcrete structure housing the garrison — approximately 40 PDF soldiers in various states of combat readiness. The barracks contain a small armoury (lasgun charge packs, autogun magazines, flak armour sets, a handful of frag grenades) accessible only with the Burgomaster's authorisation or <strong>Fortress Vallak Armory</strong> faction reward. The garrison's morale is abysmal; the soldiers obey Vallakovich out of habit and fear of Izek Strazni rather than loyalty.</p>\n<h3>The Burgomaster's Manor</h3>\n<p>A former administratum building repurposed as Vallakovich's personal residence and seat of government. Heavy blast doors, barred windows, PDF guards at every entrance. Inside: an audience chamber where Vallakovich holds court, a propaganda workshop where his latest festival plans are designed, and Izek Strazni's private quarters — a room filled with dozens of hand-carved wooden dolls, each bearing an uncanny resemblance to <strong>Ireena Kolyana</strong>. The dolls range from crude early attempts to disturbingly lifelike recent works. Izek permits no one to enter this room.</p>\n<h3>Rictavio's Wagon (Stockyard)</h3>\n<p>In the stockyard district near the outer wall, a gaudy, brightly painted carnival wagon sits among livestock pens and storage sheds. It belongs to <strong>\"Rictavio\"</strong> — Van Richten's flamboyant secondary cover identity. The wagon is reinforced with hidden plasteel plating and contains a warded cage holding a captured minor warp-beast: a daemonic entity bound for study. The wards are functional but aging — if the wagon is damaged or the wards disrupted, the beast escapes into a populated area. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Psyniscience</strong> or <strong>Forbidden Lore (Warp)</strong> Test detects the entity's presence from outside the wagon.</p>"

His eyes betray years of sleeplessness. He speaks in a loud, relentlessly cheerful cadence, as though volume can drown out the screaming in his head. Vallakovich genuinely believes the warp feeds on misery — his festivals are his solution. Each one fails. Each subsequent one must be bigger, louder, more mandatory.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Maintain control, push back the fog through enforced happiness, prove his methods work. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"Are we not BLESSED, Inquisitor? Your very presence proves the Emperor's favour! You will attend the festival, of course. Attendance is not optional.\"</em> He will attempt to co-opt the Acolytes as propaganda tools. If challenged, he becomes hostile. If openly defied, he orders their arrest.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Modified Imperial Commander. WP 40, Fel 35. Not a combatant — his power is entirely political.</p>\n<h3>Izek Strazni</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Violent, obsessive, loyal to Vallakovich. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Dangerous.</p>\n<p>Vallakovich's enforcer and right hand. A massive, scarred brute whose left arm is grotesquely oversized — warp-touched, rippling with muscle and chitinous growths, capable of generating bursts of warp-fire equivalent to a Hand Flamer with unlimited ammunition. He obeys Vallakovich without question and maintains order through intimidation and brutality. He is also obsessed with Ireena Kolyana, having commissioned dozens of dolls in her likeness despite never meeting her.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Serve Vallakovich, find the woman who matches his dolls. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"The Burgomaster says smile. So you smile. Or I make you smile.\"</em> If he sees Ireena, his behaviour becomes erratic — protective, possessive, dangerous. <strong>Profile:</strong> Heavily modified Mutant. WS 50, S 50 (100), T 45, Ag 35, WP 30. Warp-fire attack: Pistol, 10m, S/--/--, 1d10+4 E, Pen 2, Flame.</p>\n<h3>Lady Fiona Wachter</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Composed, articulate, patient, lethal. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Challenging (primarily through her cult).</p>\n<p>A handsome woman of middle years in faded finery, silver hair pinned beneath a lace veil. She smells of amasec and embalming fluid. Fiona is a Chaos cultist of the most insidious variety — not raving and mutated but philosophical and persuasive. She worships Strahd as the rightful sovereign, chosen by powers greater than the God-Emperor. She leads <strong>The Devoted</strong> — approximately twelve citizens who meet in the Wachterhaus cellar for rituals that blend political planning with genuine warp-communion.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Overthrow Vallakovich, install herself as Burgomaster, open the gates to Strahd's direct rule. She believes this will bring order. She is wrong. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"Vallakovich is a madman, Inquisitor. Surely you can see that. I offer stability. I offer sanity. I offer an end to the suffering — is that not what the Emperor would wish?\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Discovering Her Affiliation:</strong> Her Chaos ties are well-hidden. Discovery requires infiltrating Wachterhaus and finding the cellar (<strong>Hard (-20) Security</strong> or <strong>Challenging (+0) Awareness</strong>), interrogating a member of The Devoted (three successful <strong>Inquiry</strong> Tests over several in-game days), or psychic scanning (<strong>Opposed Willpower</strong> vs. WP 45; the psyker suffers 1d5 CP from her minor ward). <strong>Profile:</strong> Modified Cult Leader. Psy Rating 1 (Telepathy or Dominate). The Devoted: Cultist profiles with flak armour and stub revolvers.</p>\n<h3>Inquisitor Van Richten (\"Dr. Richtus\")</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Paranoid, exhausted, brilliant. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Challenging (as a combatant); invaluable (as an intelligence source).</p>\n<p>An elderly Ordo Malleus Inquisitor, stooped by decades of service. One augmetic eye glows faint red. His hands shake from nerve damage. He has been on Barovus for over a decade, entering the warp rift voluntarily. His cover identity — \"Dr. Richtus\" — is a traveling medicae. His secondary cover — \"Rictavio\" — is a carnival master whose wagon hides a caged warp-beast.</p>\n<p><strong>Finding Him:</strong> The Martikovs can point the Acolytes toward Dr. Richtus (<strong>Challenging (+0) Fellowship</strong> Test if they trust the party). Alternatively, investigating Rictavio's wagon leads to his hab-unit. He will not reveal himself willingly — genuine Inquisitorial identification, Ordo Malleus ciphers, or a <strong>Hard (-20) Charm</strong> Test are required. He may attack first if approached without identification.</p>\n<p><strong>Value:</strong> His data-slate contains the most comprehensive intelligence on Strahd in existence: behavioural patterns, weaknesses, thrall identities, partial Spire layout, and his theory that the warp rift is a deliberate construct maintained by Strahd's pact. He provides +20 bonuses to tests related to Strahd's weaknesses and Barovus phenomena. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"You have ten seconds to explain how you found me before I decide whether you are agents of the Inquisition or agents of the Spire. I assure you, I will know if you lie.\"</em></p>\n<h3>The Martikov Family</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Cautious, fundamentally good, hiding a dangerous secret. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Non-combatant (individually).</p>\n<p><strong>Urwin</strong> and <strong>Danika</strong> Martikov run the Blue Water Inn. They carry a stable, heritable warp-mutation — shapeshifting into ravens. They use this ability to spy on Strahd's movements and share intelligence with a loose resistance network. Ravens circling a location often indicate Martikov surveillance. They also operate the Recaf Distillery and are invested in its liberation.</p>\n<p><strong>Complication:</strong> The Acolytes are Inquisitorial agents. Mutants are abominations in Imperial doctrine. How the party handles the Martikovs' nature is a pivotal moral moment. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"We serve the Emperor in our own way, Inquisitor. Judge us if you must — but judge us after you have seen what we do for the people of this world.\"</em></p>\n<h3>Father Lucian Petrovich</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Exhausted, devout, terrified. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Non-combatant.</p>\n<p>The chapel's aging priest, tending Saint Andral's alone. He knows the bones have been stolen and suspects his altar boy, <strong>Milivoj</strong>. He confides in the Acolytes if they demonstrate faith or Inquisitorial authority. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"The Emperor's light still shines here, Acolyte. It is faint — it flickers — but it has not gone out. Not yet. Please... help me keep it burning.\"</em></p>\n<h2>Combat Encounters</h2>\n<h3>The Coffin-Maker's Shop — Warp-Thrall Ambush</h3>\n<p>Henrik's shop contains <strong>six warp-thralls</strong> hiding in packing crates and coffins. They are former citizens, psychically dominated by Strahd, transformed into predatory beings that feed on psychic emanation and blood. The confined space makes this a brutal close-quarters engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Warp-Thrall Combat Profile:</strong> WS 45, BS 20, S 45 (90), T 40, Ag 40, Int 25, Per 35, WP 30, Fel 10. Traits: Unnatural Strength (x2), Fear (1), Dark Sight, Regeneration (3). Weapons: Claws (1d10+5 R, Tearing), Bite (1d10+3 R, Life Drain). Regeneration negated by holy weapons, blessed ammunition, or silver.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactical Notes:</strong> The thralls attack in a frenzied rush when discovered. The shop's narrow corridors and low ceilings limit ranged fire and mobility. Flamers or incendiary weapons are effective but risk setting the building ablaze. If the bones have not been returned to the chapel, surviving thralls flee to attack Saint Andral's at nightfall.</p>\n<h3>Izek Strazni Confrontation</h3>\n<p>If the Acolytes defy Vallakovich or disrupt a festival, Izek arrives with <strong>1d5+2 PDF soldiers</strong> (flak armour, lasguns, WS 30, BS 35). Izek fights with his warp-fire arm and brutal melee strikes. He prioritises the most visibly defiant Acolyte unless Ireena is present — in which case, he attempts to seize her and retreat to the Burgomaster's Manor.</p>\n<h3>Fiona's Coup</h3>\n<p>If triggered, The Devoted (12 cultists: flak armour, stub revolvers, WS 25, BS 30) seize key positions while Fiona confronts Vallakovich. The Acolytes may intervene on either side or attempt to control the chaos. The PDF garrison splits — roughly half remain loyal to Vallakovich, half are uncertain and may side with whoever appears to be winning.</p>"

Strahd can see and hear through any thrall's senses as a Free Action.</li>\n<li><strong>Lady Wachter:</strong> Fiona reports to Strahd's agents, though she considers herself a willing ally rather than a puppet. Her intelligence is filtered through her own political ambitions.</li>\n<li><strong>Animal Surveillance:</strong> Strahd can scry through any natural animal on Barovus — ravens and wolves in particular. The Martikov raven network is partially compromised.</li>\n<li><strong>Servitor-Skulls:</strong> Occasional servitor-skulls drift over the settlement walls at night, observing and recording.</li>\n<li><strong>Letters:</strong> Strahd may send handwritten correspondence to the Acolytes via bat-servitors or Vostra messengers. The letters are courteous, erudite, and deeply unsettling — complimenting progress, offering advice, asking after Ireena.</li>\n<li><strong>Izek's Obsession:</strong> Strahd is aware of Izek's fixation on Ireena and finds it amusing.

The festival is a grotesque spectacle: forced singing, mandatory dancing, garish decorations, and PDF soldiers at every corner ensuring \"maximum enthusiasm.\" Citizens paste on rictus grins. A massive sun effigy of scrap metal is erected in the town square to be set alight at the climax.</p>\n<h3>Festival Outcomes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acolytes do nothing:</strong> The festival proceeds and concludes without incident. Another hollow ritual. Stability +5. Vallakovich is pleased and more amenable to cooperation.</li>\n<li><strong>Acolytes disrupt the festival (deliberately or accidentally):</strong> Stability -10. Vallakovich dispatches Izek and 1d5+2 PDF soldiers to arrest the offenders.

Stability +10. If the bones are not recovered, the thralls attack the chapel at nightfall — a horror set-piece: screaming civilians, overwhelmed PDF soldiers, Father Lucian making a last stand at the altar.

Crackdown intensifies.</td><td>Mass arrests, public executions, total paranoia. Vallakovich, increasingly unhinged, begins seeing heresy everywhere — including in the Acolytes. The settlement becomes a pressure cooker.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Both removed</strong></td><td>Stability -25. Power vacuum.</td><td>The PDF fragments. The town teeters on anarchy.

When the warp rift swallowed Barovus, the station's senior Magos died, and his apprentice, Abaron, assumed control. The decades since have not been kind to Abaron's sanity. What was once a house of science is now a cathedral of flesh: operating theatres repurposed for grotesque experimentation, vat chambers growing organs and limbs in amniotic fluid, and corridors haunted by the shambling failures of Abaron's work.</p>\n<p>Yet Abaron is the only individual on Barovus capable of maintaining Imperial cybernetics, providing genuine medical treatment, and producing pharmaceutical compounds. The Acolytes will need him — and every interaction with him costs a piece of their souls. This is body horror at its most insidious: not monsters leaping from shadows, but the slow realisation that the only doctor on this world is a madman, and you need what he offers.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas of Krezk and the Biologis Facility</h2>\n<h3>Krezk Village</h3>\n<p>A cluster of stone hab-units huddled behind a low wall on the mountainside. The village gate is always sealed and manned by two nervous civilians with autoguns they barely know how to use. Burgomaster <strong>Dmitri Krezkov</strong> refuses entry to outsiders unless they can offer something of genuine value: medical supplies, news from outside, or a solution to a local problem. Alternatively, Abaron may invite the Acolytes directly if he learns of their presence, eager for news and new subjects to study.</p>\n<p>The village marketplace trades in mountain herbs, animal pelts, and desperation. A narrow path behind the settlement leads to the <strong>Sacred Pool</strong> — a natural spring-fed pool in a rocky courtyard surrounded by weathered Imperial statues. The water is unnaturally clear and carries a faint golden luminescence visible only in darkness.</p>\n<h3>Reception and Triage (Ground Floor)</h3>\n<p>The Facility's entrance hall retains a veneer of Mechanicus order: tiled floors (cracked), directional signage in binharic and Low Gothic (faded), a reception cogitator (non-functional). A single mongrelfolk orderly shuffles forward to greet visitors, its words coming with difficulty through a mouth not designed for speech. The air carries the chemical tang of counterseptic, recaf, and something organic and sweet that catches in the throat.</p>\n<p>A triage assessment chamber adjoins the reception — a room of medical slabs and diagnostic equipment that is genuinely functional. Abaron uses this room to evaluate new patients and, less openly, to assess their potential as experimental subjects. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Awareness</strong> or <strong>Medicae</strong> Test reveals that some of the diagnostic tools have been modified beyond their standard specifications — biometric scanners that record genetic data in unusual detail, neural probes calibrated for psychic sensitivity testing.</p>\n<h3>Operating Theatres (Ground Floor)</h3>\n<blockquote><p>The operating theatre occupies the Facility's central bay, a vast chamber that was once a sterile laboratory and is now something between a surgical suite, an art gallery, and an abattoir. Vats of translucent amniotic fluid line the walls, each containing a shape in some stage of growth — here a torso, there a cluster of organs pulsing with mechanical regularity, in the far corner something that is almost a face and is trying very hard to become one. Cogitator banks hum with the processing load of a dozen simultaneous biological simulations. The floor is obsessively clean, but the air carries the sweet-copper scent of blood and the ozone tang of active augmetics.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Three operating tables occupy the centre of the room, each equipped with restraint systems and an array of surgical mechadendrites mounted on articulating arms. Two tables are empty. The third holds a mongrelfolk in the process of having a crude bionic eye installed — the subject is conscious and appears to be in considerable distress but does not cry out. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Medicae</strong> Test confirms the surgical technique is brilliant but the methodology is heretical — Abaron has abandoned Mechanicus rites, standard anaesthesia protocols, and basic ethical constraints.</p>\n<h3>Vat Chambers (Ground Floor, Rear)</h3>\n<p>A long gallery of floor-to-ceiling glass tanks filled with bubbling amniotic fluid. Each tank contains a biological experiment in various stages of development: cloned organs, hybrid tissue samples, failed homunculi curled in foetal positions, and one tank — sealed and triple-warded — containing something that pulses with a faint warp signature. A <strong>Hard (-20) Psyniscience</strong> Test identifies the warded tank's contents as warp-infused biological material — the raw substrate from which the Bride's psychic receptivity is being developed. Standing near this tank for more than 10 minutes requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Willpower</strong> Test or inflicts 1 Corruption Point.</p>\n<h3>Mongrelfolk Quarters (Ground Floor, East Wing)</h3>\n<p>A converted dormitory housing Abaron's approximately 30 mongrelfolk — his failed experiments, his servants, his congregation. The room is clean but deeply disturbing: rows of cots sized for wildly different body configurations, a communal feeding trough, crude but heartfelt shrines to the Omnissiah built from medical waste. The mongrelfolk worship Abaron with absolute devotion. Many can speak, though with difficulty. Some are lucid enough to provide information about the Facility, Abaron's routines, and the Bride's status. They will not betray Abaron willingly.</p>\n<p>Each mongrelfolk has 1d3 unique mutations or augments (telescopic eyes, extra arms, built-in vox units, wall-crawling ability, etc.) and an implanted <strong>compliance device</strong> that allows Abaron to issue commands as a Free Action. Removing a device requires a <strong>Hard (-20) Medicae</strong> Test and deals 1d10 damage to the subject.</p>\n<h3>Abaron's Private Laboratory (Upper Floor)</h3>\n<p>Accessible via a secured lift (<strong>Challenging (+0) Tech-Use</strong> or <strong>Security</strong> Test to bypass without Abaron's permission). The upper laboratory is Abaron's sanctum: pristine, temperature-controlled, humming with power. A central surgical slab dominates the room, surrounded by cogitator arrays running biological simulations of staggering complexity. Shelves hold specimen jars, data-slates filled with centuries of research, and a collection of curiosities — items with unusual energy signatures that Abaron studies without comprehending their spiritual significance. The <strong>Rosette of Saint Markovia</strong> may be among these curiosities (Tarot-dependent).</p>\n<p>On the central slab, under a halo of surgical lumens, lies the <strong>Bride</strong>. She is beautiful. She is perfect. She is the most disturbing thing the Acolytes have ever seen, because she is clearly, unmistakably not alive — and yet she breathes. The Bride is a vat-grown body of extraordinary physical perfection, grown from gene-samples harvested from the women of Krezk. She is intended as a vessel for Tatyana's soul — a gift to Strahd that Abaron believes will satisfy his obsession and end the curse.</p>\n<h3>Sacred Pool Courtyard</h3>\n<p>Behind and below the village, accessible via a narrow mountain path, a natural spring feeds a pool in a rocky clearing. Weathered statues of Imperial saints surround the pool, their features softened by centuries of wind and rain. The water is unnaturally clear and faintly luminous. This is a site of genuine residual sanctity — not as powerful as a consecrated chapel, but enough to grant +5 to Willpower Tests against corruption while within 10 metres of the water.</p>\n<p>If <strong>Ireena</strong> accompanies the Acolytes to the pool, the water reacts to her presence (see GM Reference for the full event sequence).</p>"

His mechanical components are beautifully maintained — polished chrome, precision-calibrated servo-arms, optical arrays of extraordinary resolution. His remaining organic tissue, however, is mutating: patches of luminous growth beneath translucent skin, fingers that have fused and split into new configurations, a face that is half handsome and half something that belongs in a specimen jar. He speaks in measured Mechanicus cadences, lacing his speech with binharic code-bursts that convey emotions he cannot express in Gothic.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Complete the Bride to satisfy Strahd and end the curse on Barovus. Continue his research without interference. Maintain his self-identity as a loyal servant of the Omnissiah. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"You misunderstand, Acolyte. I am not creating an abomination. I am iterating toward perfection. Each failure brings me closer to the divine configuration. Is that not the Omnissiah's own method — trial, error, refinement, truth?\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Combat Profile:</strong> WS 45, BS 40, S 45, T 50, Ag 30, Int 75, Per 45, WP 55, Fel 20. Wounds: 25. AP 6 all locations (mechanical body). Weapons: 4x Mechadendrites (1d10+5 R each, may attack with all 4 as Full Action), integrated laspistol, injector claw (1d10+3 R plus Toxin — target must pass Toughness Test or -20 to all Tests for 1d10 rounds). Traits: Mechanicus Implants, Multiple Arms (4), Dark Sight. Special: Can command up to 6 mongrelfolk as a Free Action; Flesh-Warp touch attack (target must pass Toughness Test or suffer 1d10 damage and gain a temporary mutation); Emergency Self-Repair (once per encounter, Full Action, restores 1d10+5 Wounds).</p>\n<h3>The Mongrelfolk</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Pitiable, devoted to Abaron, some are willing to help outsiders secretly. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Routine to Ordinary (individually); dangerous in groups.</p>\n<p>Abaron's failed experiments — human beings surgically and genetically modified into grotesque configurations. Extra limbs, misplaced organs, composite faces, crude mechanical grafts without anaesthetic or proper integration. Many can speak. They worship Abaron with the fervour of those who have nothing else. Their loyalty is absolute and heartbreaking.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Widely variable. WS 20-35, S 25-40, T 30-40, Ag 20-35. Wounds: 8-15. Each has 1d3 unique mutations/augments and an implanted compliance device. Not effective individually but approximately 30 in total — overwhelming numbers if provoked. Some — particularly one called <strong>\"Clovin\"</strong>, a lucid mongrelfolk with a mechanical voice box — may secretly pass information to the Acolytes if treated with kindness. Clovin knows Abaron's schedule, the Bride's location, and the weakness in the compliance devices.</p>\n<h3>The Bride</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Unconscious, incomplete, tragic. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> None (currently).</p>\n<p>A vat-grown body of extraordinary physical perfection on Abaron's central slab. She breathes but has no consciousness — a shell waiting for a soul. If completed and presented to Strahd, the consequences are catastrophic: Strahd attempts to transplant Tatyana's soul into the Bride, an act that either fails spectacularly (psychic backlash devastating the Spire) or succeeds in creating a warp-tainted vessel that Slaanesh can directly inhabit.</p>\n<p>The Bride can be destroyed, which enrages Abaron and permanently denies Strahd this option. Alternatively, the Acolytes can sabotage the process subtly (<strong>Hard (-20) Medicae</strong> or <strong>Tech-Use</strong> Test) so that the Bride appears complete but will fail upon activation — a more strategic choice that avoids immediate confrontation with Abaron.</p>\n<h3>Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Protective, grieving, pragmatic. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Non-combatant.</p>\n<p>The village leader. A quiet, broad-shouldered man who lost his son to one of Abaron's \"treatments\" and now exists in a state of cold resignation. He cooperates with Abaron because the village has no alternative for medical care. He will help the Acolytes if they offer genuine assistance to Krezk. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"The Magos keeps us alive. That is not the same as keeping us human. But when the alternative is death, you learn to accept the distinction.\"</em></p>\n<h2>Combat Encounters</h2>\n<h3>Confronting Abaron</h3>\n<p>If the Acolytes attempt to destroy the Bride or directly challenge Abaron's work, he fights. He is accompanied by 2d5 mongrelfolk servants who obey his commands without question. The Facility's corridors are narrow and filled with surgical equipment — improvised cover but also environmental hazards. Vats can be shattered (splash damage: 1d5 Toxic to anyone within 2m), mechadendrite arms on the walls can be triggered by Abaron to grasp at intruders (<strong>Challenging (+0) Agility</strong> to avoid, or become Grappled).</p>\n<h3>Mongrelfolk Uprising (Optional)</h3>\n<p>If the Acolytes remove compliance devices from several mongrelfolk or kill Abaron, the mongrelfolk react unpredictably. Some become confused and non-hostile. Others, freed from control but still mentally damaged, may lash out. A few — the more lucid ones — may rally to the Acolytes' side. This should be played as a chaotic, morally complex scene, not a simple combat encounter.</p>"

He has cultivated Abaron over centuries, nudging the Magos toward the Bride project through carefully placed suggestions and \"donations\" of genetic material. He monitors the Facility through servitor-skulls and through Abaron himself, who communicates with Strahd's agents via encrypted vox-channels (he considers this administrative correspondence, not collaboration).</p>\n<p>If Ireena visits the Sacred Pool, Strahd intervenes directly — the lightning strike and his echoing voice are a personal manifestation of his will, not a pre-set trap. This is one of the few moments where Strahd loses his composure. His voice carries genuine fury and desperation. The Acolytes should understand that they have witnessed something rare: Strahd afraid.</p>\n<p>Following the Sacred Pool event, Strahd increases surveillance of the Acolytes dramatically. Servitor-skulls appear at every rest stop. Letters arrive with greater frequency. He may send Warp-Thralls to test the party's readiness — not to kill, but to probe.</p>"

Commander Gorev led thirty Astartes and auxiliary PDF units in a campaign that lasted months and ultimately failed. Strahd, newly empowered by his daemonic pact, destroyed the Silver Drakes to the last man. Their outpost — erected as a forward operating base — stands as their tomb.</p>\n<p>The outpost is haunted. Not by random warp-echoes or psychic phenomena, but by the actual revenants of fallen Astartes — spirits bound to the material world by unfinished duty, righteous anger, and the sheer refusal of Astartes will to accept failure, even in death. They stand vigil in silent ranks, patrol corridors they died defending, and maintain a garrison that serves no living commander. For the Acolytes, this place is both a potential sanctuary and a trial: the Silver Drakes will aid those who prove worthy of their respect, but their standards are the standards of the Adeptus Astartes, and they do not lower them for mortals.</p>\n<p>This location carries the tone of tragic nobility — the grandeur of the Imperium's greatest warriors reduced to ghosts guarding an empty fortress on a forgotten world. It should evoke awe, sorrow, and the bitter question: if even Space Marines could not defeat Strahd, what chance do a handful of Acolytes have? The answer, as Commander Gorev will tell them, is that the Silver Drakes lacked one of three necessary elements. The Acolytes can succeed where the Silver Drakes failed — if their faith is absolute.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas of the Fallen Astartes Outpost</h2>\n<h3>The Courtyard</h3>\n<p>A wide, open space of cracked rockcrete and packed earth, littered with the debris of a battle fought centuries ago: spent bolter casings corroded green with age, fragments of ceramite armour, the rusted remains of combat blades. A banner pole stands in the centre, its banner long since rotted away. The wind makes a sound through the empty buildings that is almost, but not quite, a voice.</p>\n<p>The revenants are here. They do not immediately manifest — the Acolytes see them as peripheral flickers, half-glimpsed shapes in Mark VII power armour standing at attention or walking patrol routes. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Psyniscience</strong> or <strong>Awareness</strong> Test confirms the psychic residue is immense — this entire compound is saturated with the imprint of thirty Astartes who refused to accept death. The atmosphere is heavy, oppressive, and strangely reverential. This is not a haunted ruin. It is a shrine.</p>\n<p>The revenants will not interfere with the Acolytes in the courtyard unless provoked. Desecrating the outpost (defacing the chapter icon, looting openly without respect, using warp-powers casually) draws an immediate hostile response — the revenants manifest fully and demand the intruders leave. Failure to comply results in psychic assault: all Acolytes within the courtyard suffer a <strong>Hard (-20) Willpower</strong> Test or take 1d10 Energy damage (warp) and are forcibly expelled through the gate.</p>\n<h3>The Barracks</h3>\n<p>Two long hab-structures flanking the courtyard. The interiors are empty but preserved with eerie precision — bunks made with military corners, equipment lockers sealed, personal effects arranged with parade-ground order. Dust does not settle here. The air is cold but clean. Each bunk bears a name-plate in High Gothic: the names of the thirty Silver Drakes who died on Barovus.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Challenging (+0) Scholastic Lore (Imperial)</strong> or <strong>Common Lore (War)</strong> Test allows an Acolyte to identify the name-plates as a roster of the strike force. Cross-referencing with any available records (Van Richten's data-slates contain fragmentary references) confirms the Silver Drakes were a Codex-compliant chapter with a reputation for tenacity and faith-driven warfare. Their loss on Barovus is not recorded in any surviving Imperial archive — the chapter itself may have assumed the strike force was lost in the warp.</p>\n<h3>The Armoury and Relic Vault</h3>\n<p>A reinforced structure at the rear of the compound, its blast doors sealed but not locked — they open with a grinding protest when pushed. The armoury proper has been mostly looted over the centuries: empty weapon racks, depleted ammunition crates, disassembled heavy weapons stripped of critical components. The smell of old gun oil and sacred unguents lingers.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Hard (-20) Search</strong> Test reveals a <strong>hidden compartment</strong> behind a false wall panel (triggered by pressing the Silver Drake chapter icon in a specific sequence — a <strong>Challenging (+0) Logic</strong> or <strong>Common Lore (Adeptus Astartes)</strong> Test to deduce). The compartment contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2d5 Astartes bolt rounds</strong> (blessed, +10 damage against warp entities)</li>\n<li>A <strong>combat knife of exceptional quality</strong> (Best Craftsmanship mono-edged, 1d10+3 R, Pen 2)</li>\n<li>A <strong>data-crystal</strong> containing the Silver Drakes' complete tactical analysis of their campaign against Strahd — invaluable intelligence that grants +10 to all tests related to planning the assault on the Zarovich Spire</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>relic vault</strong> — a gene-locked inner chamber — may contain <strong>Dawn's Edge</strong> (Tarot-dependent). Opening the vault requires a Space Marine's gene-seed (impossible under normal circumstances) or a <strong>Very Hard (-30) Tech-Use</strong> Test to bypass the biometric lock. Commander Gorev can open it if he judges the Acolytes worthy.</p>\n<h3>The Chapel</h3>\n<p>Dedicated to the Emperor, the chapel is the spiritual heart of the outpost and the site of the <strong>Trial of Faith</strong>. It is a simple space: stone walls, an altar of black marble bearing a tarnished but intact aquila, rows of stone benches worn smooth by centuries of phantom congregants. A faint golden light emanates from the altar — residual sanctity that persists despite everything. The chapel and its immediate surroundings function as weak Sanctified Ground: warp entities suffer -5 to all Tests within 10 metres, and Corruption Tests gain +5.</p>\n<p>The stained-glass windows depict scenes from the Silver Drakes' history: their founding, their victories, and — in the final window, shattered and crudely repaired with lead — their last stand on Barovus. The repaired window shows Commander Gorev, recognisable even in abstract glass, standing alone against a figure of shadow and cold fire. The figure is Strahd.</p>\n<h3>The Strategium</h3>\n<p>The Silver Drakes' command centre, located in the outpost's central building. A circular room dominated by a hololith projector table (non-functional — the power cells died centuries ago) surrounded by cogitator banks (also dead). The walls are covered in faded tactical maps of Barovus, annotated in precise Astartes notation.</p>\n<p>A pict-slate beneath a fallen rafter contains fragmentary records of the campaign against Strahd — tactical analyses, after-action reports, and a final, desperate entry from Commander Gorev:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\"He cannot be killed by mortal arms alone. The blade must be sanctified. The light must be pure. The faith must be absolute. We had two of three. Emperor forgive us.\"</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>This entry is critical intelligence. It confirms the three-element requirement for Strahd's destruction (Dawn's Edge, the Rosette, and absolute faith) and reveals that the Silver Drakes came agonisingly close to success. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Scholastic Lore (Tarot)</strong> or <strong>Logic</strong> Test connects this entry to the Emperor's Tarot reading — the three relics the Acolytes seek correspond to what the Silver Drakes lacked.</p>\n<h3>The Beacon Tower</h3>\n<p>The outpost's highest point — a cylindrical tower rising above the compound walls, crowned by a large apparatus of polished lenses, psycho-reactive crystal arrays, and focusing mechanisms. This is the <strong>Silver Drake Beacon</strong>: a device designed to project a concentrated beam of psychoactive faith-energy visible for hundreds of kilometres. It is non-functional. Its power source — a skull carved from psycho-reactive crystal, pulsing with the residual faith of a long-dead Chapter Master — was taken from the outpost after the Silver Drakes fell.</p>\n<p>The apparatus itself is intact and can be examined with a <strong>Challenging (+0) Tech-Use</strong> Test. The focusing mechanisms are sound. The crystal arrays are undamaged. All it needs is its heart — the Chapter Master's skull — and a psyker to channel the activation sequence.</p>"

He appears as a translucent figure in battered Mark VII power armour — a massive figure even by Astartes standards, with a face carved from stone and eyes that burn with cold fire. His voice carries the weight of centuries of unfinished duty. He does not appear immediately upon the Acolytes' arrival; he observes them from the chapel, judging their conduct and intent before revealing himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> See Strahd destroyed and his battle-brothers' mission completed. Find mortals worthy of the task the Silver Drakes could not finish. Maintain the honour of his chapter. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"We came to this world with bolter and blade and the Emperor's fury. It was not enough. Strahd von Zarovich broke us — not through greater strength, but through a darkness that our weapons could not cut. We had the blade. We had the faith. We did not have the light. You must succeed where we failed, mortals. The Emperor demands it. I demand it.\"</em></p>\n<p>If the Acolytes pass the Trial of Faith, Gorev becomes a powerful ally. He provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access to the relic vault (if Dawn's Edge is located there)</li>\n<li>Sacred oils (3 applications: grant the <em>Sanctified</em> quality to a weapon for 24 hours)</li>\n<li>+10 to Willpower Tests while within the outpost</li>\n<li>Bolter ammunition (2d5 rounds, blessed, one-time gift)</li>\n<li>Tactical counsel on the Spire assault (+10 to Strategic planning Tests)</li>\n<li>The Chapter Master's skull location (if he knows it — this depends on GM decisions)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Chaplain Vladimir Horngaard</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Bitter, mad, actively hostile to any effort to destroy Strahd. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Severe (the outpost's most powerful revenant).</p>\n<p>The spirit of the outpost's second-in-command — a Chaplain of the Silver Drakes. Unlike Gorev, Vladimir has been driven insane by centuries of undeath. He does not want Strahd destroyed. He wants Strahd to <em>suffer</em> — to exist forever in his cursed state, trapped and miserable, as punishment for what he did to the Silver Drakes. In Vladimir's twisted logic, killing Strahd would be a mercy, and mercy is the last thing the monster deserves.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Ensure Strahd suffers eternally. Prevent anyone from granting Strahd the release of death. Maintain his grip on the lesser revenants who follow him. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"You would END him? You would grant him PEACE? No. No! He destroyed us. He broke our chapter's honour. He murdered thirty brothers of the Emperor's own design. And you would let him DIE? Death is too kind. Let him rot in this prison he built. Let him hunger and rage and remember what he lost — FOREVER. That is justice. That is what the dead deserve.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Combat Profile (if it comes to violence):</strong> Vladimir is a revenant with Astartes Chaplain characteristics. WS 65, BS 50, S 55 (110), T 55 (110), Ag 40, Int 45, Per 50, WP 70, Fel 35. Wounds: 40. Spectral ceramite armour (AP 10 all locations, immune to mundane weapons — only holy, blessed, force, or psychic attacks deal full damage; mundane weapons deal half damage). Weapons: Spectral Crozius Arcanum (Melee, 2d10+12 E, Pen 8, Power Field, Holy — deals double damage to warp-touched entities), Spectral bolt pistol (Pistol, 30m, S/2/--, 1d10+9 X, Pen 5, Tearing, Blessed). Traits: Fear (3), Unnatural Strength (x2), Unnatural Toughness (x2), From Beyond, Incorporeal (can phase through solid matter). He is accompanied by 1d5+2 lesser revenants (WS 50, S 45, T 50, Wounds 25, spectral bolters and combat blades).</p>\n<h3>The Lesser Revenants</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Divided — some follow Gorev's honourable pragmatism, others follow Vladimir's bitter obsession. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Challenging (individually); Severe (in groups).</p>\n<p>Approximately 30 revenant Space Marines haunt the outpost. They manifest as translucent figures in Mark VII power armour, moving through patrol routines and garrison duties with mechanical precision. Most are silent. A few murmur prayers to the Emperor in voices like wind through broken glass. They are divided between Gorev's faction (those who wish to see their mission completed) and Vladimir's faction (those consumed by hatred).</p>\n<p>The lesser revenants will not attack the Acolytes unless provoked or ordered to by Vladimir. If the Acolytes prove worthy through the Trial of Faith, Gorev's faction stands down entirely and may provide passive assistance (opening doors, pointing out hidden areas, warding against warp intrusions). Vladimir's faction remains hostile and must be dealt with separately.</p>\n<h2>The Trial of Faith</h2>\n<p>Entering the chapel triggers the trial. The revenants of the Silver Drakes manifest, forming ranks in the nave — thirty spectral Astartes in full battle gear, their bolters held at port arms, their eyes burning with cold judgement. Commander Gorev manifests at the altar and demands the Acolytes justify their presence.</p>\n<h3>Mechanical Resolution</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Psychic Endurance:</strong> Each Acolyte must pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Willpower</strong> Test to withstand the psychic pressure of thirty angry Astartes revenants. Failure inflicts 1d5 Insanity Points and the Acolyte is visibly shaken (-10 to Fellowship Tests for the remainder of the trial).</li>\n<li><strong>The Speech:</strong> One Acolyte (chosen by the party or the GM) must address Commander Gorev and explain their mission, their devotion to the Emperor, and their plan to destroy Strahd. This is resolved as a <strong>Hard (-20) Fellowship</strong> or <strong>Command</strong> Test. The GM should grant bonuses for genuine roleplaying effort (+10 to +20 for an impassioned, in-character speech), for presenting evidence of their mission (Inquisitorial rosette, Van Richten's intelligence, recovered relics), and for demonstrating knowledge of the Silver Drakes' sacrifice (+5 per relevant fact cited).</li>\n<li><strong>Judgement:</strong> On success, Gorev declares the Acolytes worthy. The revenants salute — a spectral crack of ceramite gauntlets striking chest-plates — and stand aside. On failure, the revenants dismiss the Acolytes as unworthy and they are expelled from the chapel. No damage, but the shame is significant. They may attempt the trial again after accomplishing a notable deed against Strahd's forces.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Vladimir's Opposition</h2>\n<p>If the Acolytes attempt to activate the Beacon or seek Gorev's full blessing, Vladimir intervenes. He manifests in the Beacon Tower or chapel with 1d5+2 lesser revenants, blocking the way. He does not attack immediately but delivers a furious, unhinged tirade about how Strahd must suffer, not die.</p>\n<h3>Resolution Options</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> A <strong>Very Hard (-30) Fellowship</strong> Test. Vladimir is an Astartes Chaplain and will not be easily swayed. Arguments based on the Emperor's will or the honour of the Silver Drakes have the best chance. Success convinces him to stand aside (but not to help). Failure enrages him further.</li>\n<li><strong>Combat:</strong> Vladimir is a formidable opponent (see combat profile above). Defeating him does not destroy him permanently — he reforms in 1d5 days — but it removes his opposition for the immediate objective.</li>\n<li><strong>Gorev's Intervention:</strong> If the Acolytes have Gorev's full support and have proven themselves through significant deeds, Gorev confronts Vladimir directly. The two revenants engage in a spectral duel — the outcome depends on whether the Acolytes have sufficiently impressed Gorev (GM discretion). If Gorev prevails, Vladimir retreats in bitter silence.</li>\n<li><strong>Creative Solutions:</strong> The GM should reward creative approaches — invoking the Silver Drakes' chapter oaths, presenting evidence that Strahd's destruction will cause more suffering than his continued existence, or appealing to Vladimir's buried sense of duty rather than his dominant rage.</li>\n</ul>"

A column of pure golden light punches through the fog of Barovus and into the sky.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Beacon Effects</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warp Suppression:</strong> All warp activity within visual range of the Beacon is reduced. Warp-touched creatures suffer -10 to all characteristics while in its light.</li>\n<li><strong>Hope:</strong> The citizens of Barovus can see the Beacon from every settlement. Settlement morale improves. NPCs in all locations become more cooperative (+5 to Fellowship-based Tests campaign-wide).</li>\n<li><strong>Strahd's Rage:</strong> Strahd is enraged. He makes destroying the Beacon a priority, likely sending a major force against the outpost (2d5 Warp-Thralls, 1d5 Elite Guards, possibly led by a personal lieutenant). The Acolytes must decide whether to defend the Beacon or let it fall — its destruction does not undo the hope it inspired, but its loss is a significant blow to morale.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Loot and Items of Interest</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hidden Armoury Compartment:</strong> 2d5 Astartes bolt rounds (blessed, +10 damage vs. warp entities), Best Craftsmanship mono-edged combat knife (1d10+3 R, Pen 2), campaign data-crystal (+10 to Spire assault planning)</li>\n<li><strong>Sacred Oils:</strong> 3 applications (each grants the <em>Sanctified</em> quality to a weapon for 24 hours).

Strahd is aware of the outpost's existence and its haunted nature, but he does not fear the ghosts — they cannot leave the compound, and their hatred is impotent without living agents to act on their behalf. He considers the outpost a monument to his victory.</p>\n<p>This changes dramatically if the Beacon is activated. The pillar of faith-light is a direct challenge to Strahd's dominion — visible, symbolic, and mechanically damaging to his forces. He responds with escalating force:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Within hours:</strong> Servitor-skulls arrive to assess the situation. Strahd sends a letter to the Acolytes via bat-servitor: <em>\"I congratulate you on repairing an antique. I trust you understand that antiques, however beautiful, are fragile things.\"</em></li>\n<li><strong>Within one day:</strong> A raiding force of Warp-Thralls and Elite Guards probes the outpost's defences.</li>\n<li><strong>Within three days:</strong> A full assault force arrives. If the Acolytes are present, this is a major combat encounter. If they have moved on, the Beacon may fall without their defence (GM discretion based on narrative pacing — the revenants fight but cannot hold indefinitely against physical enemies they struggle to harm).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strahd himself does not attack the outpost. The revenants' psychic presence makes him uncomfortable — not afraid, but uncomfortable, like a man returning to the site of a crime he does not regret but cannot forget. If confronted here during a personal visit, he is uncharacteristically terse and leaves quickly. This is one of the few locations on Barovus where Strahd is not entirely at ease.</p>"

The twelve standing stones — xenos in origin, their provenance unknown — serve as amplifiers, focusing warp energy into a concentrated upwelling that manifests as perpetual reality distortion. Time flows strangely here: minutes may pass as hours, or hours as seconds. Colours shift without source. Shadows move independently of light. The air tastes of copper and ozone, and the ground itself seems to breathe.</p>\n<p>The Warp-Tree is a manifestation of Strahd's subconscious — a psychic echo of a tree from his original homeworld, from a garden where he once knew peace. The warp has corrupted it into a living conduit that channels immaterium energy into realspace. As long as the Tree stands, Strahd's control over the landscape of Barovus is strengthened. Sacred Seed #1, stolen from the Recaf Distillery, is embedded in the Tree's root system, feeding its unnatural growth. This directly links the Nexus to the Distillery quest chain — recovering the seed requires destroying or severely damaging the Tree.</p>\n<p>The cultists gathered here are the <strong>Nature-Corruption Devotees</strong> — desperate humans who have abandoned the Imperial Creed in favour of worshipping the warp as a primal force of transformation. They are not sophisticated heretics; they are broken people who chose to embrace mutation rather than die fighting it. Their leader, the massive mutant warlord <strong>Wintersplinter</strong>, was once human — now a three-metre monstrosity of bark-like skin, root-tendril limbs, and a face that is half-man, half-tree. The Devotees are attempting a twelve-hour summoning ritual that, if completed, will tear a permanent warp-gate into realspace, flooding Barovus with daemonic entities beyond any settlement's ability to withstand. The Acolytes must stop them.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas</h2>\n<h3>A. The Approach — Fog-Choked Hillside</h3>\n<p>The Warp Nexus sits one travel segment from the Recaf Distillery, reached by a cross-country route through corrupted woodland. The final approach is a steep, treeless hillside — the vegetation refuses to grow within two hundred metres of the stones. The ground is a vitrified crust that crunches underfoot and occasionally gives way to soft, fleshy pockets that leak warmth. Fog clings thickly to the lower slopes but thins near the summit, replaced by the shimmering heat-haze of concentrated warp energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Paths:</strong> Four rough trails climb the hill from each cardinal direction. The southern approach offers the most cover (scattered boulders and dead stumps), while the northern approach is the steepest but shortest. Cultist sentries (2 per path) patrol the lower slopes during the ritual — <em>Challenging (+0) Stealth</em> Test to bypass them, or <em>Ordinary (+10) Awareness</em> to detect them first. If a sentry spots intruders, they raise the alarm with a ululating warp-touched cry that carries unnaturally far, alerting Wintersplinter and the ritual circle within 1d5 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental Hazard:</strong> The vitrified ground is treacherous. Moving at full speed requires an <em>Ordinary (+10) Agility</em> Test or the Acolyte stumbles, taking 1d5 Impact damage from the razor-sharp glass-like crust. The warp saturation intensifies as the Acolytes climb — upon reaching the stone circle perimeter, every Acolyte must pass an <em>Ordinary (+10) Willpower</em> Test or gain 1 Insanity Point from the sheer wrongness of the environment.</p>\n<h3>B. The Stone Circle — Twelve Xenos Monoliths</h3>\n<p>Twelve standing stones form a rough circle approximately forty metres in diameter at the hilltop. Each stone is carved from a material that defies classification — neither stone, metal, nor crystal, but something that shifts subtly between all three depending on the angle of observation. Alien sigils cover every surface, deeply incised and still sharp-edged despite their apparent antiquity. The sigils glow faintly, cycling through colours that have no names in Low Gothic. Each stone is warm to the touch and vibrates at a sub-audible frequency that sets teeth on edge and makes augmetic components flicker.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ritual:</strong> One Nature-Corruption Devotee stands at each stone, chanting in a pre-Gothic language. The ritual requires twelve cultists chanting for twelve hours, one per stone. Removing a cultist from a stone by any means — killing, incapacitating, dragging them away — disrupts the ritual for 1d5 rounds but does not end it permanently. A new cultist can take the vacated position. To permanently neutralise a stone, the Acolytes must <strong>cleanse</strong> it: place a sanctified object at its base (an Aquila pendant, blessed ammunition, holy water) or have a psyker channel a Sanctification rite (<em>Hard (-20) Willpower</em> Test). A cleansed stone goes dark and silent. Three or more cleansed stones end the ritual permanently.</p>\n<p><strong>The Vision Quest:</strong> Any psyker who touches a standing stone — or any Acolyte who touches the Warp-Tree — receives an overwhelming psychic vision of Strahd's pact with Slaanesh. The vision is vivid, immersive, and indistinguishable from reality for 1d5 rounds. It shows a young officer kneeling before a mirror that reflects not his face but the visage of a Daemon Prince — beautiful, terrible, and vast beyond comprehension. The young man speaks: <em>\"I accept. Give me what I desire, and I am yours.\"</em> The garden dies. The tree bleeds. The sky darkens. And Strahd von Zarovich stands, no longer young, his eyes the eyes of something that will never die and will never stop hungering.</p>\n<p>The vision inflicts <strong>1d10 Corruption Points</strong> and <strong>1d5 Insanity Points</strong>, both halved (round down) on a successful <em>Hard (-20) Willpower</em> Test. It also grants critical intelligence: the nature of Strahd's pact (Slaanesh), the moment of its inception, and the price he paid (his humanity, his world, everything). This information is invaluable for the campaign's endgame.</p>\n<h3>C. The Warp-Tree — Heart of the Nexus</h3>\n<p>The Tree dominates the summit. Twenty metres tall, its trunk wider than a Leman Russ battle tank, its branches spread against the sky like the grasping fingers of a drowning man. It is made of wood and meat and something else — a substance that shifts between organic and mineral, pulsing with a slow, rhythmic cadence like a heartbeat. Sap the colour of old blood seeps from cracks in its bark, and where it drips, the ground writhes with tiny, boneless things that are born, suffer, and die in seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Seed #1</strong> is embedded in the Tree's root system, visible as a faintly golden glow beneath the bark at the Tree's base. Recovering it requires destroying the Tree or severing its warp connection (see GM Reference for mechanics).</p>\n<p><strong>Root-Tendrils:</strong> The Tree is immobile but not passive. Any creature within 5 metres is subject to lashing root-tendrils: <strong>S 50, 1d10+8 I damage, Flexible</strong>. The tendrils attack reflexively — the Tree has no tactical awareness but reacts to proximity.</p>\n<p><strong>Warp Saturation:</strong> The air within the stone circle is so thick with warp energy that unprotected psykers suffer Psychic Phenomena on any doubles when using powers, not just matching tens digits. Non-psykers who spend more than 30 minutes within the circle without warp protection must test for Corruption (<em>Challenging (+0) Willpower</em> or gain 1d5 CP per 30 minutes).</p>\n<h3>D. The Ritual Clearing</h3>\n<p>A flat area between the stone circle and the Tree's trunk serves as the Devotees' camp. Crude shelters of hide and warp-warped wood, a central fire pit burning with violet flame that gives heat but no light, and offerings piled at the Tree's base: dead animals, severed human limbs, and crude icons shaped from fused bone. <strong>Wintersplinter</strong> typically stands guard here, a towering sentinel of bark and sinew, unmoving unless the alarm is raised.</p>\n<p>If the Acolytes approach stealthily and observe, they can count the cultists, identify Wintersplinter's position, and plan their assault. An <em>Ordinary (+10) Scrutiny</em> Test reveals that three of the chanting cultists appear to be flagging — exhausted by hours of sustained ritual. These three are the weakest links and could be removed with minimal resistance.</p>"

Most bear minor mutations: extra fingers, discoloured skin, eyes that glow faintly in darkness, vestigial growths. They wear ragged robes over emaciated bodies and fight with crude weapons: autoguns held together with wire, blades of fused bone, and their own mutated limbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Use Cultist profiles with the following modifications: +5 WP (sustained warp exposure has hardened their minds), minor random mutation (roll once on the Minor Mutation table per Devotee), and <em>Resistance (Fear)</em> — they have seen too much to be frightened by anything mortal.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactics:</strong> The ritual cultists will not willingly leave their stones. They fight from their positions, calling for aid rather than abandoning the chant. Reserve Devotees mob intruders in groups of 3-4, attempting to overwhelm with numbers. If Wintersplinter falls, morale collapses — surviving Devotees must pass a <em>Challenging (+0) Willpower</em> Test or flee into the fog.</p>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> The Devotees cannot be reasoned with through conventional means. They believe the warp is the natural order and the Imperium is the aberration. However, an Acolyte who succeeds on a <em>Very Hard (-30) Charm</em> or <em>Intimidate</em> Test can shake the faith of an individual Devotee long enough to pull them from their stone — they will not fight, but collapse weeping. This approach costs 1 Insanity Point to the Acolyte who attempts it, as the Devotee's broken worldview is genuinely pitiful.</p>\n<h3>Wintersplinter — Mutant Warlord</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Guardian of the Tree, territorial, animalistic intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Severe</p>\n<p>Wintersplinter was once a man — a farmer, perhaps, or a labourer. Now it is a three-metre hulk of bark-armoured flesh, its limbs replaced by root-tendril appendages of terrible strength, its face split vertically between something recognisably human and the grooved, sap-weeping surface of living wood. It does not speak, but it understands Low Gothic and responds to the Devotees' commands with grunting compliance. It is utterly devoted to the Tree and will fight to the death to protect it.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Use a modified <strong>Chaos Spawn</strong> profile with the following adjustments:</p>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>WS</th><th>BS</th><th>S</th><th>T</th><th>Ag</th><th>Int</th><th>Per</th><th>WP</th><th>Fel</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody><tr><td>Value</td><td>55</td><td>--</td><td>60 (180)</td><td>55</td><td>25</td><td>15</td><td>30</td><td>35</td><td>--</td></tr></tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Wounds:</strong> 60 | <strong>Armour:</strong> Natural Armour (AP 4 all) | <strong>Movement:</strong> 3/6/9/18</p>\n<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Root-Tendrils (Melee; 2d10+18 I; Pen 2; Flexible, Snare), Slam (Melee; 1d10+18 I; Concussive [2])</p>\n<p><strong>Traits:</strong> Fear (2), Unnatural Strength (x3), Natural Armour (4), Size (Enormous), Dark Sight, Bestial</p>\n<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Entangling Roots:</strong> All Acolytes within 10 metres of Wintersplinter must pass a <em>Challenging (+0) Agility</em> Test each round or become Immobilised until they spend a Full Action cutting free (Strength Test at +0 or appropriate weapon attack against the root, TB 4, Wounds 8).</li>\n<li><strong>Regeneration (5):</strong> Wintersplinter recovers 5 Wounds at the start of each turn. Fire damage negates this regeneration for 1 round. Severing the Tree's warp connection permanently ends Wintersplinter's regeneration.</li>\n<li><strong>Tree-Bond:</strong> While the Warp-Tree stands, Wintersplinter gains +10 to all Characteristics and its Regeneration increases to 8. Destroying the Tree causes Wintersplinter to howl in agony and lose all bonuses immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tactics:</strong> Wintersplinter charges the nearest threat and attempts to Immobilise as many enemies as possible with Entangling Roots before focusing on isolated targets with its Slam attack. It does not pursue fleeing enemies beyond the stone circle perimeter — it will not leave the Tree undefended. If reduced below 20 Wounds while the Tree still stands, it retreats to the Tree's base and fights from within the root-tendril zone, using the Tree's own attacks as additional defence.</p>\n<h3>Encounter Phases</h3>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 — Disruption:</strong> The Acolytes engage the outer sentries and begin cleansing or clearing stones. Devotees at the stones resist but do not abandon their posts. Wintersplinter activates and moves to intercept. Reserve Devotees attack from the camp.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 — The Warlord:</strong> Wintersplinter engages in full melee. The Tree's root-tendrils lash at anyone within range. If three or more stones are cleansed, the ritual energy destabilises — warp phenomena occur at random (roll on the Warp Phenomena table each round, affecting a random combatant).</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3 — Collapse:</strong> When Wintersplinter is destroyed or the Tree is severed/destroyed, the remaining Devotees break. The warp energy dissipates visibly — the shimmering heat-haze fades, the stones go dark, and for the first time, natural wind blows across the hilltop. If Sacred Seed #1 is recovered, it glows with a warm golden light that is physically painful for warp-touched creatures to approach.</p>"

The Tree is immobile and does not dodge or parry, but its root-tendrils (S 50, 1d10+8 I, Flexible) lash reflexively at anything within 5 metres. Fire damage is doubled against the Tree. Blessed or holy weapons ignore its TB entirely.</p>\n<p><strong>Psychic Severance:</strong> A psyker may attempt an <em>Extended Opposed Willpower Test</em> against the Tree's WP 60. The psyker must accumulate 3 Degrees of Success before the Tree accumulates 3. Each round of the contest, the psyker suffers 1d5 CP from direct warp exposure (no save). Success severs the Tree's connection — it withers and dies over 1d5 rounds, releasing Sacred Seed #1 without the explosive warp surge of physical destruction.</p>\n<h3>Loot and Items</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sacred Seed #1:</strong> A small, golden seed that radiates warmth and faint light. Warp-touched creatures cannot approach within 2 metres. When replanted at the Recaf Distillery, it partially restores the crops' anti-corruption properties.</li>\n<li><strong>Xenos Stone Fragment:</strong> If an Acolyte chips a fragment from a standing stone (<em>Hard (-20) Strength</em> or appropriate tool), the fragment retains residual psychic properties. A psyker carrying it gains +5 to Psyniscience Tests but suffers nightmares (1 IP per week of possession). Worth significant value to the Ordo Xenos if the Acolytes ever leave Barovus.</li>\n<li><strong>Wintersplinter's Core:</strong> A fist-sized knot of petrified wood and crystallised warp-matter from Wintersplinter's chest cavity. Can be used as a component in warding rituals (+10 to Willpower Tests to resist warp entities for 24 hours when worn) or traded to Madam Eva for a significant favour.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultist Salvage:</strong> 1d5 functional autoguns (Poor condition), assorted crude blades, 2d10 rounds of mixed ammunition, and scattered personal effects that provide minor lore about the Devotees' former lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quest Connections</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recaf Distillery:</strong> Sacred Seed #1 is critical for restoring the Distillery's anti-corruption properties. The Martikovs will be deeply grateful — permanently improving their disposition toward the Acolytes (+20 to all Fellowship Tests with Martikovs).</li>\n<li><strong>Three Sacred Seeds:</strong> Seed #1 is here, Seed #2 is at Berez (Baba Lysaga), Seed #3 is at Zarovich Spire. Recovering all three fully restores the Distillery.</li>\n<li><strong>Strahd's Reaction:</strong> Destroying the Tree visibly weakens warp-corruption across Barovus — the fog thins, the sky brightens marginally. Strahd becomes aware of the Acolytes as a genuine threat and escalates his attention accordingly. He is not angry; he is impressed. And that is worse.</li>\n<li><strong>Vision Quest Intelligence:</strong> The vision of Strahd's pact is one of the most important pieces of narrative intelligence in the campaign. It confirms the Slaanesh connection, the voluntary nature of the pact, and the scale of the price paid. This information is critical for the Empyrean Vault visit and the final confrontation.</li>\n<li><strong>Emperor's Tarot:</strong> If the Tarot reading designated Dawn's Edge as located at the Warp Nexus (The Pyre result), the relic power sword is embedded in the Tree's trunk and must be physically wrenched free (<em>Challenging (-10) Strength</em> Test while enduring 2d10 E damage per round from warp exposure).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strahd's Presence</h3>\n<p>Strahd does not appear at the Warp Nexus in person — the site is one of the few places on Barovus where his control is not absolute, as the xenos stones predate his pact and operate on principles he does not fully understand. However, his psychic echo permeates the Tree, and the Vision Quest is effectively a direct window into his past. He becomes aware of any Acolyte who experiences the vision and may comment on it during future encounters: <em>\"You saw the garden. You saw the mirror. Tell me — did you understand what you saw, or did you merely observe?\"</em></p>\n<p>If the Tree is destroyed, Strahd feels it as a physical pain — a momentary weakening of his connection to the land. He sends a servitor patrol (1d5+2 Elite Guards) to investigate within 2d10 hours. The Acolytes should be well clear by then.</p>"

He is <em>interested</em>. And that is far more dangerous than anger.</p>"

The Approach — Unstable Scree Slope</h3>\n<p>The crashed transport is located in the foothills between Fortress Vallak and the Warp Nexus, approximately one travel segment off the main road. Reaching it requires a <em>Challenging (+0) Navigate (Surface)</em> Test. The terrain is steep and unstable — loose scree, concealed sinkholes, and fog that clings to the hillside like gauze. Failure wastes 1d5 hours on false trails before finding the wreck.</p>\n<p><strong>Unstable Hillside:</strong> The slope surrounding the transport is treacherous. Approaching the cargo bay requires an <em>Ordinary (+10) Agility</em> Test. Failure means a minor slide: 1d5 Impact damage from tumbling scree, and the noise attracts attention — increase the number of warp-mutant scavengers in the encounter by +2. The scree provides poor footing: all movement on the slope counts as Difficult Terrain (half speed).</p>\n<p><strong>Warp-Flora Patches:</strong> Clumps of warp-corrupted vegetation dot the lower hillside — fleshy, bulbous growths with thorn-like protrusions that weep a bioluminescent ichor. Contact with the thorns requires a <em>Routine (+20) Toughness</em> Test or the Acolyte suffers 1d5 Toxic damage (ignoring armour) and a lingering numbness in the affected limb (-5 to tests using that limb for 1d10 rounds). The patches can be avoided with an <em>Ordinary (+10) Awareness</em> Test to spot them in the fog.</p>\n<h3>B. The Forward Cab</h3>\n<p>The Ridgehauler's forward cab is crushed from the impact, its armoured windscreen shattered and its control consoles buckled inward. The driver's remains are still strapped into the command throne — a skeleton in a rotted Munitorum transport uniform, one hand still gripping the steering yoke. A rosary of the Emperor hangs from the rearview mirror, its beads fused together by heat.</p>\n<p><strong>Salvageable Items:</strong> A <em>Challenging (+0) Search</em> Test recovers the following from the cab: a damaged but partially functional field vox-caster (range 5km, but broadcasts on a fixed frequency that Strahd's network monitors — the Acolytes will not know this without a <em>Hard (-20) Tech-Use</em> Test to diagnose), a personal data-slate belonging to the driver (contains a partial route map of the convoy's intended path and a final, panicked log entry describing the mutant ambush), and a laspistol with 2 charges remaining (Good condition).</p>\n<p><strong>The Driver's Log:</strong> The data-slate's final entry reads: <em>\"They came from the trees. Emperor preserve us. Kolya is dead. The road is gone. I am driving blind. If anyone finds this — the cargo is intact. Get it to Vallak. The garrison needs it. The garrison needs—\"</em> The entry ends abruptly. An <em>Ordinary (+10) Literacy</em> or <em>Common Lore (Imperial Guard)</em> Test confirms the convoy was an official Munitorum resupply run, lending legitimacy to claiming the cargo.</p>\n<h3>C. The Cargo Bay — The Prize</h3>\n<p>The rear cargo compartment is tilted at approximately thirty degrees but structurally sound. The exterior is scarred by claw marks and scorch damage from the original mutant attack, but the reinforced plasteel hull held. The cargo bay door is sealed with a standard Munitorum cipher-lock.</p>\n<p><strong>Opening the Lock:</strong> Requires a <em>Challenging (+0) Security</em> Test or a <em>Hard (-20) Strength</em> Test to force the corroded mechanism. An Acolyte with <em>Common Lore (Munitorum)</em> or <em>Common Lore (Imperial Guard)</em> recalls the standard emergency override codes, reducing the Security Test to <em>Routine (+20)</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Interior:</strong> Inside, crates are stacked and strapped to cargo rails, shifted by the angle but largely intact. Moisture-proof cases bear Munitorum stencils and Imperial Aquilas. The air inside is stale but dry — the seals held. Everything is covered in a fine layer of dust, undisturbed for decades.</p>\n<h3>Cargo Manifest</h3>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Quantity</th><th>Condition</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Lasgun Charge Packs</td><td>12</td><td>Good</td><td>Standard Imperial issue, sealed in moisture-proof cases</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Autogun Magazines (30-round)</td><td>8</td><td>Good</td><td>Wrapped in oiled cloth, still functional</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Bolt Pistol Magazines</td><td>2</td><td>Good</td><td>Rare and valuable; clearly intended for officer resupply</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Frag Grenades</td><td>6</td><td>Fair</td><td>Seals intact but corroded; 10% chance per grenade of delayed detonation (1 round late)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Krak Grenades</td><td>2</td><td>Good</td><td>Sealed in individual blast-proof cases</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Medikits</td><td>3</td><td>Fair</td><td>Drugs degraded; Medicae Tests using these suffer -10</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Ration Packs</td><td>20</td><td>Good</td><td>Sealed stasis-packaging; effectively fresh</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Flak Armour Sets</td><td>2</td><td>Good</td><td>Standard Imperial Guard issue, still serviceable</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Carapace Chest Plate</td><td>1</td><td>Good</td><td>Officer-grade; AP 6 to Body location</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Micro-bead Vox Units</td><td>4</td><td>Fair</td><td>Functional but range reduced to 500m due to age</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Magnoculars</td><td>1</td><td>Good</td><td>Standard issue with low-light enhancement</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Auspex (Hand-held)</td><td>1</td><td>Poor</td><td>Unreliable; -10 to Auspex Tests; intermittent in warp-heavy areas</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>D. The Surrounding Hillside</h3>\n<p>The hillside around the wreck is warp-mutant territory. Shallow caves in the scree serve as dens, littered with gnawed bones and scraps of corroded metal. A crude path through the rocks — barely visible — leads from the treeline to the transport's cargo bay, indicating the mutants have been circling the wreck for some time, unable to breach the Munitorum lock. Rock outcroppings at various elevations provide cover positions for both the Acolytes and their enemies. The upper map edge represents the fog ceiling — above this line, visibility drops to near zero.</p>"

They may already be attempting to breach the cargo bay, or they arrive drawn by noise shortly after the Acolytes open it. They are disorganised and desperate — starving creatures fighting over scraps. They attack on sight but break and flee if more than half their number are killed. One mutant, larger than the rest and bearing a crude lasgun with 1 charge remaining, serves as the pack alpha.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 — Hillside Collapse:</strong> The noise of combat triggers a partial landslide. At the <strong>end of Round 3</strong>, all combatants must pass a <em>Challenging (+0) Agility</em> Test or be knocked Prone and swept 1d10 metres downhill, taking 1d10+3 I damage from tumbling rocks and scree. The cargo bay door is partially buried by displaced earth — clearing it requires a <em>Challenging (+0) Strength</em> Test (+10 if two Acolytes work together). This is the moment of maximum tension: the Acolytes are mid-combat, the ground is shifting beneath them, and the prize is slipping away.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3 — Observation:</strong> As the Acolytes secure the cargo, a servitor-skull descends from the fog overhead. Unlike the dead one bolted to the door, this skull is very much active: its optics glow red, its anti-grav unit hums softly, and it hovers just out of easy reach, panning slowly across the scene. It records everything. It does not intervene. After approximately one minute, it rises back into the fog and flies north — toward the Zarovich Spire. The skull has <strong>Ag 50</strong> and <strong>TB 2, Wounds 6</strong> if the Acolytes attempt to shoot it down. Destroying it changes nothing — Strahd has dozens — but it may make the Acolytes feel better.</p>\n<h3>Corruption and Insanity</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warp-flora contact:</strong> 1d5 Toxic damage (ignoring armour) on failed <em>Routine (+20) Toughness</em></li>\n<li><strong>No significant Corruption or Insanity triggers at this location.</strong> The crashed transport is one of the rare \"clean\" sites on Barovus — no warp rituals, no daemonic presence, no psychic residue. This is intentional: the horror here is entirely mundane. Desperation, scarcity, and the knowledge that someone is always watching.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Loot and Items</h3>\n<p>See the Cargo Manifest table in Key Areas. This is a <strong>one-time supply cache</strong> — once claimed, it is gone. The GM should emphasise to the players that this is an exceptional find. Nothing else like it exists on Barovus. Additional minor salvage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forward cab:</strong> Damaged vox-caster (5km range, monitored frequency), laspistol (2 charges), driver's data-slate (partial route map, lore)</li>\n<li><strong>Mutant salvage:</strong> Crude weapons (negligible value), 1d5 ration packs (partially consumed, unappetising but edible), assorted scrap metal</li>\n<li><strong>Vehicle components:</strong> An Acolyte with <em>Trade (Armourer)</em> or <em>Tech-Use</em> can strip useful components — fuel cells (enough for a small generator or to recharge 2d10 lasgun packs), replacement armour plates, wire and cable (useful for field repairs and traps)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quest Connections</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Resupply:</strong> The cargo manifest represents the single largest equipment boost available in the campaign. Smart distribution of these supplies among the party is a tactical decision worth spending real time on.</li>\n<li><strong>Strahd's Interest:</strong> Strahd now knows the Acolytes have armed themselves from his claimed stockpile. He is not angry — the supplies are meaningless to him. He is <em>interested</em>. He may reference this during a future encounter: <em>\"I see you helped yourselves to my property. I do not mind. A well-equipped adversary is far more entertaining than a desperate one.\"</em></li>\n<li><strong>Fortress Vallak:</strong> The driver's data-slate and the cargo's Munitorum markings provide evidence that the Lord-Governor has been hoarding or neglecting Imperial supply lines — useful leverage in political dealings with Burgomaster Vallakovich or Lady Wachter.</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing Surveillance:</strong> The servitor-skull observation establishes a pattern. From this point forward, the Acolytes should assume Strahd knows their approximate location and equipment status at all times. Paranoia is appropriate and should be encouraged.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strahd's Presence</h3>\n<p>Strahd does not appear in person at the crash site. His presence is felt through the dead servitor-skull's territorial claim and the live servitor-skull's silent observation. The encounter is designed to make the Acolytes understand two things simultaneously: first, that Barovus is a world of scarcity where every bullet matters; and second, that Strahd's dominion extends even to abandoned wrecks on remote hillsides. Everything on Barovus belongs to him. The Acolytes are taking what is his. He allows it — because it serves his entertainment.</p>\n<p>If the Acolytes have already drawn significant attention (destroyed the Warp-Tree, killed Strahd's forces in Fortress Vallak, etc.), the servitor-skull may carry a recorded message in Strahd's voice: <em>\"You continue to impress. Please — take what you need. I insist. The hunt is more satisfying when the quarry believes it has a chance.\"</em> This message inflicts 1 Insanity Point (no save) from the casual, absolute certainty of a predator who has never been prey.</p>"

It is operated by an extended branch of the Martikov family, the same warp-touched shapeshifters who run the Blue Water Inn in Fortress Vallak. When the Acolytes arrive, the distillery is under active assault by warp-corrupted flora — ambulatory vine-creatures animated by the same energy that feeds the Warp-Tree at the Nexus — and a raiding party of Nature-Corruption Devotees sent to ensure the distillery's destruction.</p>\n<p>This location is the keystone of the campaign's supply and alliance systems. Liberating the distillery accomplishes three things simultaneously: it secures a reliable source of food, recaf, and medicinal herbs for the Acolytes and their allies; it launches the Three Sacred Seeds quest chain that spans three other major locations; and it forces the Acolytes to confront the Martikovs' secret — that their most valuable allies on Barovus are warp-touched mutants whose existence violates every tenet of Imperial doctrine. The moral dilemma is deliberate and has no clean resolution.</p>\n<p>The distillery's unique properties — its crops grow despite the warp-corruption, its recaf has mild anti-corruption effects — derive from three sacred seeds blessed by a Ministorum saint centuries ago and planted in the distillery's soil. All three have been stolen, and the distillery is dying. Without at least one seed, the crops will fail within weeks and the last reliable food source on Barovus will be gone.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas</h2>\n<h3>A. Perimeter Defences — Barricades and Watchtowers</h3>\n<p>The distillery complex is surrounded by a low stone wall — waist-height, originally designed to mark property boundaries rather than repel assault. The Martikovs have reinforced it with makeshift barricades: overturned carts, stacked barrels, sheets of corrugated plasteel scavenged from nearby ruins. Two crude watchtowers — little more than raised platforms with sandbag walls — stand at the eastern and western corners, each equipped with a mounted stubber (5 rounds remaining in each).</p>\n<p><strong>Breach Points:</strong> When the Acolytes arrive, the eastern barricade has been breached. Corrupted Plant-Forms are pouring through the gap, their root-limbs tearing at the stonework. The western barricade still holds but is under pressure — 1d5 Devotees are attempting to set it alight with crude incendiaries. An Acolyte who reaches the eastern breach can reinforce it with a <em>Challenging (+0) Strength</em> Test (pushing debris back into the gap) or by destroying the Plant-Forms in the breach zone.</p>\n<p><strong>The Watchtowers:</strong> Each tower is occupied by a Martikov family member with an autogun. The eastern tower's occupant is wounded and pinned down by Devotee fire. The western tower's occupant — <strong>Adrian Martikov</strong>, Davian's grandson — is holding his position but running low on ammunition. Reaching either tower requires crossing open ground under fire (<em>Challenging (+0) Agility</em> Test to avoid 1d10+3 I damage from Devotee autogun fire).</p>\n<h3>B. Main Distillery Floor — Processing Hall</h3>\n<p>The heart of the complex: a long, high-ceilinged stone hall filled with copper stills, fermentation vats, piping networks, and the heavy, aromatic scent of recaf processing. The machinery is old — three centuries old, in fact — but lovingly maintained by generations of Martikovs. Several vats are ruptured, their contents pooling on the flagstone floor in dark, steaming puddles. A Corrupted Plant-Form has infiltrated through a broken window and is growing into the machinery, its root tendrils wrapping around pipes and threatening to destroy the processing equipment.</p>\n<p><strong>The Processing Equipment:</strong> If the Plant-Form is not cleared from the machinery within 10 rounds of the Acolytes entering, it fuses permanently with the stills, rendering them inoperable. Clearing the Plant-Form from the machinery without damaging the equipment requires either careful melee work (<em>Challenging (+0) WS</em> with a called shot, or any attack that deals fire damage — the Plant-Form is <strong>Vulnerable to Fire</strong>, taking double damage) or a <em>Hard (-20) Tech-Use</em> Test to activate the emergency steam venting, which scalds the Plant-Form for 2d10 E damage but also risks damaging the pipes (10% chance).</p>\n<p><strong>Fermentation Vats:</strong> The large copper vats provide Heavy Cover (+8 AP to one location) but are pressurised — a stray shot that penetrates a vat causes it to rupture, spraying scalding liquid in a 3-metre radius (1d10 E damage, Ag Test to dodge). There are 6 intact vats; each can only rupture once.</p>\n<h3>C. Storage Cellars — Barrels and Hidden Passage</h3>\n<p>Below the main floor, accessed by a stone stairway, the cellars extend beneath the entire complex. Rows of recaf barrels line the walls — most are empty, a testament to how depleted the distillery's reserves have become. The air is cool, damp, and tinged with the earthy smell of aged recaf. Warp-flora has not penetrated here yet, making the cellars a relatively safe refuge for wounded Martikovs and non-combatants.</p>\n<p><strong>The Seed Vault:</strong> Behind a false wall at the cellar's deepest point lies a small chamber — the original planting room where the three sacred seeds were blessed and sown. The soil beds are empty, their sanctified earth grey and lifeless without the seeds. A faded Ministorum prayer scroll on the wall identifies the chamber's purpose: <em>\"By the Emperor's Grace, these seeds shall nourish the faithful and deny sustenance to the corrupt.\"</em> Replanting a recovered seed here requires pressing it into the soil and reciting any Imperial prayer or litany — the seed does the rest, glowing golden as it takes root.</p>\n<p><strong>Hidden Passage:</strong> A narrow tunnel behind the seed vault leads to an exit point fifty metres outside the perimeter wall. The Martikovs use this as an escape route. An <em>Ordinary (+10) Search</em> Test reveals the tunnel if the Acolytes explore the cellars; the Martikovs will reveal it voluntarily if they trust the Acolytes.</p>\n<h3>D. Martikov Family Quarters — Upper Floor</h3>\n<p>The upper floor of the main building serves as living quarters for the extended Martikov family. Modest but clean rooms with hand-sewn furnishings, shelves of salvaged books, children's drawings pinned to walls, and a communal dining area. It is conspicuously normal — a reminder that people live here, raise families here, and are fighting to protect something that matters to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Davian's Study:</strong> The patriarch's private room contains a locked desk (<em>Ordinary (+10) Security</em> to pick, or Davian provides the key if trusted). Inside: a hand-drawn map of Barovus with Martikov raven-surveillance routes marked, a journal documenting Strahd's troop movements over the past decade, and a sealed letter addressed to <em>\"whoever comes after us\"</em> — a contingency confession of the family's shapeshifter nature, written in case they are killed, asking that whoever reads it understand they only ever wanted to protect the people of Barovus.</p>\n<p><strong>The Martikovs' Secret:</strong> During the battle to liberate the distillery, the Martikovs shift between human and raven form without thinking to hide it — diving from upper windows as ravens to scout enemy positions, shifting back to human form to relay information, carrying messages between watchtowers in avian form. If the Acolytes have not already learned the family's nature at the Blue Water Inn, this is the moment of revelation. The moral dilemma is immediate: these mutants are risking their lives to defend humanity. Doctrine demands their destruction. Pragmatism — and perhaps conscience — demands their preservation.</p>"

Davian has led the family for four decades, coordinating their intelligence network across Barovus from this distillery and the Blue Water Inn. He is practical, unsentimental, and deeply protective of his family. He does not trust easily — the Acolytes must prove their opposition to Strahd through action, not words.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Wary. Davian has seen outsiders before — Strahd has sent agents disguised as travelers. He will cooperate with the Acolytes during the siege out of necessity, but full trust requires completing the liberation and demonstrating genuine commitment to opposing the Lord-Governor.</p>\n<p><strong>What He Knows:</strong> The location of all three sacred seeds (one at the Warp Nexus, one with Baba Lysaga in Berez, one at the Zarovich Spire). Strahd's recent troop movements and patrol patterns. Van Richten's identity and location in Fortress Vallak. The political dynamics of every surviving settlement. He shares this intelligence incrementally, releasing more valuable information as trust increases.</p>\n<p><strong>What He Wants:</strong> The sacred seeds returned. The distillery secured. His family safe. In that order.</p>\n<h3>Adrian Martikov — Grandson, Scout</h3>\n<p>Young, reckless, and fiercely loyal to the family. Adrian is the distillery's best scout — fastest in raven form, sharpest eyes, and a talent for getting into places he should not be. He is manning the western watchtower when the Acolytes arrive and will be the first Martikov to interact with them during the siege.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Eager. Adrian wants to fight Strahd. He sees the Acolytes as the warriors the family has been waiting for and may overshare information in his enthusiasm, earning a sharp rebuke from Davian.</p>\n<h3>Martikov Combat Profile (Human Form)</h3>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>WS</th><th>BS</th><th>S</th><th>T</th><th>Ag</th><th>Int</th><th>Per</th><th>WP</th><th>Fel</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody><tr><td>Value</td><td>30</td><td>35</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>45</td><td>40</td><td>50</td><td>40</td><td>35</td></tr></tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Wounds:</strong> 12 | <strong>Armour:</strong> Improvised flak (AP 2 body) | <strong>Weapons:</strong> Autogun, knife</p>\n<p><strong>Shapeshifter:</strong> As a Half Action, a Martikov can shift to raven form (Flyer 8, Size Puny, cannot attack, +30 Stealth, +20 Awareness) or back to human form. The shift is instantaneous and painless. Equipment does not transform — it falls where they stand.</p>\n<h3>Besieging Forces</h3>\n<h3>Corrupted Plant-Forms</h3>\n<p><strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Challenging (per swarm)</p>\n<p>Ambulatory masses of warp-corrupted vegetation — writhing tangles of thorned vines, pulsing root-tendrils, and bulbous fruiting bodies that burst to release clouds of toxic spores. They are not intelligent, but they are relentless, drawn to the distillery's sacred soil like parasites to a host.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile (Swarm):</strong> TB 3, Wounds 30 per swarm. Immune to single-target ranged weapons (use Blast, Spray, or melee area attacks). <strong>Vulnerable to Fire</strong> — fire damage is doubled. Each swarm occupies a 5m x 5m area and attacks all creatures within it: 1d10+3 R damage, Toxic (failed <em>Toughness</em> Test = additional 1d5 damage ignoring armour). Swarms move at half speed and cannot climb.</p>\n<p><strong>Number:</strong> 2d10 individual Plant-Forms, treated as 2-4 swarm groups depending on party strength.</p>\n<h3>Nature-Corruption Devotees (Raiding Party)</h3>\n<p><strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Ordinary (individually); Challenging (as a group)</p>\n<p><strong>Number:</strong> 1d5+3</p>\n<p>A raiding party from the Warp Nexus, sent to ensure the distillery's destruction. They are better armed and more organised than the Plant-Forms — they carry autoguns, crude incendiaries (treat as fire bombs: 1d10+4 E, Blast 2, sets targets alight), and fight with the desperate conviction of true believers. Their leader, a scarred woman with bark growing from her scalp, coordinates the assault from the treeline with hand signals.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Use Cultist profiles with minor random mutations, +5 WP, and <em>Resistance (Fear)</em>.</p>\n<h3>Liberation Encounter</h3>\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Clear the distillery of all hostile forces. This is a multi-front battle — the Acolytes must manage the eastern breach, the western barricade, the Plant-Form infiltration of the processing floor, and the Devotee fire from the treeline simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>Victory Conditions:</strong> The siege breaks when all Plant-Form swarms are destroyed and the Devotee raiding party is killed or routed. Devotees flee if their leader is killed or if they take 50% casualties. Plant-Forms continue mindlessly until destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactical Notes:</strong> Fire is the Acolytes' best weapon against the Plant-Forms. The fermentation vats contain alcohol-rich liquid that can be used as improvised incendiaries (<em>Ordinary (+10) Intelligence</em> to think of this; <em>Challenging (+0) Agility</em> to deploy without self-immolation). The Martikovs in raven form provide real-time intelligence on enemy positions — the GM should relay enemy movements to the players each round as the ravens report back. The hidden tunnel in the cellars can be used for flanking manoeuvres.</p>"

No save — it is simply a sorrowful truth.</li>\n<li><strong>Moral dilemma — the Martikovs:</strong> No mechanical Corruption or Insanity cost for accepting mutant allies. The cost is narrative: the Acolytes must carry the knowledge that they have chosen pragmatism over doctrine, and that choice will resonate throughout the rest of the campaign.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Loot and Items</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recaf Supply (ongoing):</strong> If the distillery is secured, the Acolytes gain access to unlimited ration packs and recaf. Recaf consumption provides a mild anti-corruption effect: +5 to the next Corruption Test after consumption (once per day). This bonus is cumulative with prayer but not with other alchemical effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Medicinal Herbs:</strong> The distillery gardens produce herbs with minor medicinal properties. Access to these herbs grants +10 to Medicae Tests when treating wounds at the distillery.</li>\n<li><strong>Davian's Intelligence:</strong> The journal and map in Davian's study provide +10 to all Navigate (Surface) Tests on Barovus and +10 to any Intelligence-based Tests to predict Strahd's troop movements or patrol patterns.</li>\n<li><strong>Martikov Raven Network:</strong> If the Martikovs trust the Acolytes, they provide ongoing intelligence via their raven surveillance network.

This is one of the most valuable strategic assets in the campaign.</li>\n<li><strong>Incidental Salvage:</strong> 2d5 autogun magazines, 1d5 frag grenades (taken from defeated Devotees), crude incendiaries (1d5, treat as fire bombs), miscellaneous tools and supplies.</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing Income:</strong> 2d10 Thrones per visit from surplus recaf trade, usable for purchases from the Vostra or other traders.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Three Sacred Seeds — Quest Chain</h3>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Seed</th><th>Location</th><th>Recovery Method</th><th>Effect When Replanted</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Seed #1</strong></td><td>The Warp Nexus (Yester Hill)</td><td>Destroy or sever the Warp-Tree; seed is embedded in the root system</td><td>Partial restoration — crops begin growing again within days, recaf anti-corruption bonus increases to +10</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Seed #2</strong></td><td>Berez — Baba Lysaga's lair</td><td>Defeat or outwit Baba Lysaga; she uses it as a warp-ritual power source</td><td>Significant restoration — crop yield doubles, medicinal herb potency increases (+15 to Medicae), the distillery's wards begin repelling lesser warp entities</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Seed #3</strong></td><td>Zarovich Spire — Strahd's private collection</td><td>Infiltrate the Spire and steal it from Strahd's trophy room</td><td>Full restoration — the distillery becomes a sanctified zone (warp entities cannot enter, +10 WP to all within the perimeter, Corruption Tests gain +20 bonus).

NPCs in supplied settlements become more cooperative (+10 to all Fellowship-based Tests). The Acolytes can requisition basic supplies — ration packs, medikit refills, low-grade ammunition — without cost.</li>\n<li><strong>The Warp Nexus:</strong> The Devotees besieging the distillery are from the Nexus. Liberating the distillery reveals the connection and provides motivation to assault the Nexus and recover Seed #1.</li>\n<li><strong>Berez:</strong> Davian can provide intelligence on Baba Lysaga's lair and the location of Seed #2, including warnings about the walking hab-unit and the swamp's hazards.</li>\n<li><strong>Blue Water Inn:</strong> The Martikovs at the distillery and the Blue Water Inn are the same family. Helping one branch earns trust with the other. Urwin Martikov at the Inn will share additional intelligence once he learns the Acolytes liberated the distillery.</li>\n<li><strong>Emperor's Tarot:</strong> If the Tarot reading designated any item or ally as located at the Recaf Distillery (The Cellar result), it is found in the seed vault sub-basement — a hidden chamber beneath the empty seed beds, accessible only through holy intent or a <em>Willpower</em> Test.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strahd's Presence</h3>\n<p>Strahd does not appear at the distillery in person — the location is beneath his direct attention, a minor nuisance rather than a threat. However, the Devotee raiding party was dispatched at his indirect behest. He tolerates the Nature-Corruption cult because their worship of the warp strengthens his domain, and he occasionally directs their aggression toward targets he wants destroyed without dirtying his own hands.</p>\n<p>If the Acolytes liberate the distillery, Strahd takes note but does not retaliate immediately. He has patience measured in centuries. He may send a congratulatory message via servitor-skull: <em>\"How industrious. You have saved a recaf distillery. I confess I am almost moved. The Martikovs are useful creatures, are they not? Such loyalty. Such devotion. One almost forgets what they are.\"</em> The implication is clear — he knows the Martikovs are mutants, and he is reminding the Acolytes that he could reveal this to the settlements at any time, destroying the trust the family has built over generations. This threat should hang over the Acolytes for the remainder of the campaign.</p>"

Berez was a village once. You can see the bones of it: hab-blocks reduced to crumbling walls protruding from the swamp like rotten teeth, a watchtower listing at a terminal angle, the rusted skeleton of a ground-car half-submerged in muck. The water glows at night — a sickly phosphorescent green that illuminates the underside of the fog and casts shadows that move against the light. Things wade through the shallows: bloated grey shapes with empty eyes and mouths open in silent screams. And somewhere deeper in, something massive is moving. You hear the groan of stressed metal, the squelch of enormous footfalls in deep mud, and a voice — old, cracked, singing a lullaby in a language you do not know but somehow understand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Key Fact</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Act</strong></td><td>Act II — The Domain of Dread</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Map Ref</strong></td><td>Map 9 (40×35 swamp/ruin grid)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Population / Status</strong></td><td>None living.

Approximately two centuries ago, a woman named Marina was born here, a previous reincarnation of Tatyana. When the villagers recognised her resemblance to the figure Strahd coveted and killed her in a desperate attempt to avoid his attention, the Lord-Governor’s fury manifested as a catastrophic psychic event that diverted a river, flooded the settlement, and slaughtered every living thing within it. The dead did not stay dead. They still wade through the black water, mindless and hungry, and the swamp itself has become saturated with warp energy so thick it is almost tangible.</p>\n\n<p>The sole inhabitant of note is <strong>Baba Lysaga</strong>, the Warp-Hag — a being of impossible antiquity who claims to be Strahd’s spiritual mother. She dwells in a walking hab-unit that lurches through the swamp on massive mechanical legs, and she guards her domain with psychic powers of terrifying potency. Lysaga possesses the second sacred seed stolen from the Recaf Distillery, using its residual sanctity as fuel for her warp-rituals. She will not part with it willingly. She will not part with anything willingly. She considers every aspect of Strahd’s existence her personal charge, and she will destroy anyone she perceives as a threat to “her baby” with maternal ferocity that borders on the apocalyptic.</p>\n\n<p>For the Game Master, Berez serves a dual narrative purpose. First, it is a high-danger combat location — Lysaga is one of the most dangerous non-Strahd enemies in the campaign, and arriving unprepared is a near-certain party kill. Second, the Marina monument at the centre of the ruins contains a critical lore revelation: the full cycle of Tatyana’s reincarnations across centuries, each life ending in tragedy orchestrated by Strahd’s obsession. If Ireena is present when this monument is discovered, the psychic resonance it triggers will change the trajectory of the entire campaign. The Acolytes should leave Berez waterlogged, battered, and haunted — but armed with knowledge that Strahd’s curse is far older and far more terrible than they imagined.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas</h2>\n\n<h3>A1. The Approach — Swamp Roads</h3>\n<p><strong>The road from Fortress Vallak deteriorates over two travel segments into a waterlogged track barely distinguishable from the surrounding marshland.</strong> The last half-segment has no road at all — only mudflats, stagnant pools, and dense banks of fog that reduce visibility to 15 metres. The air stinks of organic decay and something sweeter underneath: the cloying, chemical scent of warp-saturation.</p>\n<p>Movement through the swamp is at <strong>half speed</strong>. All <strong>Agility-based Tests suffer −10</strong> due to sucking mud, hidden sinkholes, and submerged debris. The water ranges from ankle-deep to waist-deep depending on the path chosen, and deeper channels exist that can swallow a fully armoured Acolyte without warning (<strong>Challenging (+0) Awareness</strong> Test to spot before stepping in; <strong>Challenging (+0) Strength</strong> Test to pull free if submerged). Plague revenants are encountered at a rate of <strong>1d5 every 30 minutes</strong> of exploration — they rise from the water with little warning, and the terrain makes fighting them significantly more dangerous than on solid ground.</p>\n\n<h3>A2. The Ruined Settlement</h3>\n<p><strong>The remains of Berez proper emerge from the waterline like the ribcage of a drowned giant.</strong> Walls of prefabricated Imperial hab-blocks jut from the black water at angles that speak of catastrophic subsidence. Rooftops that were once ground-level now serve as the only dry ground. Interior spaces are flooded, their contents reduced to sludge and corrosion, though occasionally a scavenging party can recover small items — a corroded data-slate, a waterlogged prayer book, a child’s toy fused with rust.</p>\n<p>Navigation through the ruins requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Navigate (Surface)</strong> or <strong>Survival</strong> Test to maintain direction. The ruins are disorienting: identical hab-block shells repeat in rows, the water reflects the perpetual grey sky so that up and down become uncertain, and the warp-glow beneath the surface creates the impression of structures continuing beneath the waterline — structures that were never there. Acolytes who fail navigation tests by three or more degrees find themselves circling back to their starting point, having lost 1d5 hours.</p>\n\n<h3>A3. Marina’s Monument</h3>\n<p><strong>Near the centre of old Berez, on a raised platform of cracked rockcrete that still sits above the waterline, stands a stone marker approximately two metres tall.</strong> It is weathered but legible: a carved relief of a young woman’s face surrounded by Imperial aquilas and devotional script. The inscription reads, in faded High Gothic: <em>“For Marina, who was loved too well by the wrong power. The Emperor protect her soul, for no one else could.”</em></p>\n<p>The monument radiates a faint psychic resonance detectable by any psyker or any Acolyte who passes a <strong>Difficult (−10) Psyniscience</strong> Test. If <strong>Ireena Kolyana is present</strong>, the monument triggers a full psychic vision: Ireena (and all Acolytes within 5 metres) experiences a cascade of images and sensations — dozens of lives, each a woman with Tatyana’s face, each born on Barovus across the centuries, each found by Strahd, each ending in tragedy. Marina drowned. Another fell from the Spire. Another was burned as a witch. Another simply vanished. The vision lasts approximately one minute of real time but feels like hours. All who experience it gain <strong>1d5 Insanity Points</strong> but also gain the knowledge that Strahd’s obsession is a cycle — Tatyana’s soul is reincarnated again and again, and Strahd has never once succeeded in claiming her. This information is critical for several of the Ireena endgame resolutions in Act IV.</p>\n\n<h3>A4. Baba Lysaga’s Walking Hab-Unit</h3>\n<p><strong>The walking hab-unit is impossible to miss once encountered: a standard-pattern Imperial prefabricated dwelling module, approximately 8 metres long and 4 metres wide, mounted on four massive mechanical legs of uncertain origin.</strong> The legs are a fusion of industrial walker components, salvaged servitor limbs, and something organic — they flex and grip with an unsettling fluidity that no purely mechanical system should possess. The hab-unit’s exterior is festooned with fetishes: bones, defiled holy symbols, strips of flayed skin inscribed with warp-runes, and dozens of crude dolls made from mud and hair that Lysaga insists are “my baby’s toys.”</p>\n<p>The hab-unit moves through the deepest parts of the swamp, its legs keeping the structure above the waterline. Lysaga occupies the upper compartment, which she has converted into a nauseating combination of living quarters, ritual chamber, and trophy room. The sacred seed from the Recaf Distillery is kept here, along with any Tarot-designated artifacts the GM has placed in Berez. A skull-mounted sentry gun is bolted to the hab-unit’s roof — a salvaged heavy stubber on an automated gimbal that Lysaga can direct with a thought (<strong>BS 35, 1d10+4 I, Pen 3, Full Auto, 60m range</strong>).</p>\n<p>The interior stinks of spoiled food, rendered fat, and warp-ozone. Every surface is covered in wax, dried blood, and incomprehensible scrawl. Among the refuse, Acolytes who search carefully (<strong>Hard (−20) Search</strong> Test) can find fragments of genuine intelligence: old data-slates with records of Strahd’s early rule, handwritten observations of his behaviour spanning centuries, and — disturbingly — detailed notes on the Tatyana reincarnation cycle that suggest Lysaga has been tracking and, in some cases, manipulating it.</p>\n\n<h3>A5. The Dock Ruins</h3>\n<p><strong>At the settlement’s eastern edge, the remnants of a small river dock project from the water.</strong> Before the flooding, Berez relied on river trade. Now the dock pilings are encrusted with something that is not quite fungus and not quite coral — a bioluminescent growth that pulses faintly in the green-lit darkness. A single flat-bottomed boat, miraculously intact, is tied to one of the pilings. It can carry up to four Acolytes and provides faster transit through the flooded ruins than wading (<strong>Ordinary (+10) Navigate (Surface)</strong> to handle it), but using it makes the party conspicuous and draws plague revenants from a wider radius.</p>"

Her skin ripples and shifts as though something beneath it is trying to get out. Her fingers are too long. Her smile is too wide. Her eyes are solid black, depthless pools that reflect nothing. She was present at Strahd’s birth, served as his nursemaid, and claims with absolute conviction — and homicidal ferocity toward any who dispute it — that she is his true mother.</p>\n<p>She made pacts with warp-entities before Strahd was born, shaping events across decades to ensure his rise to power. In her mind, everything she has done — every murder, every corruption, every abomination — has been an act of maternal love. This makes her not merely dangerous but <em>tragic</em>, in the way that only 40k villainy can be: a being whose devotion is genuine, absolute, and utterly insane.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Social Interaction:</strong> Lysaga will speak with the Acolytes briefly before attacking, but <em>only</em> if they do not mention Strahd in a threatening context. She responds well to flattery about her “son” and may provide information about Barovus’s history if the Acolytes pretend to admire Strahd’s rule (<strong>Very Hard (−30) Deceive</strong> Test). Any mention of harming, opposing, or “freeing” Strahd triggers immediate, berserk hostility. There is no diplomacy path that avoids combat if the Acolytes’ mission is known.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Psychic Powers:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Power</th><th>Action</th><th>Effect</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Warp Fire</strong></td><td>Half</td><td>20m cone, 3d10+7 E damage, Pen 4, Flame quality.

She can only be targeted separately via a <strong>called shot at −20</strong> through the observation slit. The hab-unit attacks independently with <strong>Stomping Legs</strong> (2d10+10 I, Pen 5, Concussive [2]) and <strong>Warp-Animated Tendrils</strong> (1d10+8 R, Snare: Strength test at −10 or Grappled; 1d10+8 R automatic damage per round while grappled).</p>\n<p>The hab-unit is <strong>warp-animated</strong> — it has no machine spirit and is immune to Tech-Use and haywire effects. It <em>is</em> vulnerable to holy/blessed weapons, which ignore 10 points of its Armour. If reduced to 0 SI, it collapses. Lysaga must pass an Agility test or take 2d10 I damage, then fights on foot. <strong>Destroying the vehicle first is the recommended tactical approach.</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Plague Revenants</h3>\n<p><strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Ordinary (dangerous in groups of 6+) | <strong>Wounds:</strong> 15 | <strong>AP:</strong> 2</p>\n<p>The swamp is <em>full</em> of them. Bloated, grey, leaking dark fluid, they rise from the water at a rate of 1d5 every 30 minutes. In combat with Lysaga, she can Animate Dead to summon 1d5 more per round. They attack with toxic fists/teeth (1d10+3 R, Toxic — Toughness test or 1d10 additional damage ignoring armour). They are Mindless, Shambling (act last in initiative, cannot Run), and Undying (on Critical Damage, roll 1d10: on 1–5 they ignore it; permanently destroyed only by fire, blessed weapons, or head destruction).</p>\n<p>The miasma released when they are destroyed forces all within 3 metres to pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Toughness</strong> Test or suffer 1d10 Toxic damage ignoring armour. In the close confines of the swamp, this creates a cascading hazard during large-scale engagements.</p>\n\n<h3>Combat Encounter: Lysaga’s Last Stand</h3>\n<p>This is a <strong>major boss encounter</strong> and should be treated as such. Lysaga fights from within her walking hab-unit, deploying psychic powers while the vehicle itself engages in melee. She is accompanied by <strong>2d10 plague revenants</strong> at combat start, with reinforcements arriving via Animate Dead. Her warp-crow swarm provides additional area denial.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain advantages favour Lysaga:</strong> deep water restricts Acolyte movement, unstable ground prevents stable firing positions, and limited cover means ranged attackers are exposed to her Warp Fire and Death’s Embrace. The Acolytes should be advised (through Van Richten, Vostra contacts, or their own reconnaissance) that Berez is a <strong>lethal location</strong> requiring preparation. Arriving without anti-armour weapons, blessed ammunition, or a solid tactical plan is a likely TPK.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactical Notes for the GM:</strong> Lysaga’s primary weakness is her emotional instability. She is insane, and her insanity can be exploited. Taunts about Strahd not loving her, claims that the Acolytes have Strahd’s blessing, or presenting a convincing forgery of a letter from Strahd (<strong>Very Hard (−30) Deceive</strong>) can cause her to hesitate for 1 round (stunned, processing emotional distress) or redirect her attacks toward the source of the emotional threat rather than the most tactically appropriate target. This is not a reliable strategy, but it can buy precious time.</p>"

He considers her a useful tool and an amusing relic, but he does not love her — a fact that would shatter her if she ever learned it. If the Acolytes are about to deliver the killing blow, there is a <strong>25% chance</strong> Strahd intervenes via psychic projection: his voice echoes across the swamp, thanking the Acolytes for “pruning the old growth” and expressing mild regret that “Mother” could not adapt to the times. This intervention does not save Lysaga — it merely demonstrates Strahd’s casual cruelty and his willingness to discard even his most devoted servants. If Lysaga hears this, she suffers a psychic breakdown: stunned for 2 rounds, weeping, before fighting with renewed and utterly desperate fury (+10 to all combat tests, −20 to all defensive tests).</p>\n<p>Strahd monitors the Acolytes’ progress through Berez via warp-crows and plague revenants serving as passive sensors. He is aware of their arrival within 1d5 hours and tracks their movements thereafter. If they recover the Marina monument’s revelation, he sends a letter via bat-servitor within 24 hours: a single line in elegant script — <em>“Now you understand. She was always mine. She will always be mine.”</em></p>"

Its surface is covered in script — angular, flowing, beautiful, and utterly alien. No human hand carved these words. No human mind conceived them. They were old when humanity was young. The door stands open. It has stood open for a very long time. Beyond it, darkness — not the absence of light but the presence of dark, a tangible, breathing thing that presses against your lamp-packs and lumen-globes like a living membrane.

The entities were sealed in chambers of psycho-reactive material that dampened their power and prevented their escape. The facility has been deteriorating for millennia. The wards are weakening.

This is the information the Acolytes need to win. But to reach it, they must walk through a gauntlet of containment cells, each holding an ancient daemon that has had millennia to perfect the art of temptation. Every cell they pass whispers to them. Every daemon offers power tailored to their deepest desires and fears. Some Acolytes will accept. The Corruption cost is severe. The consequences are permanent. And the Game Master should make every offer genuinely, achingly tempting — because the horror of the Vault is not that daemons offer power, but that the power is <em>real</em>, and the price is one that desperate people, fighting a war they are losing, might rationally choose to pay.</p>\n\n<p>The Vault is also where <strong>Kasimir Velikov</strong> seeks to resurrect his murdered sister, Patrina, using the power of a bound entity.

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas</h2>\n\n<h3>B1. The Mountain Approach</h3>\n<p><strong>The Empyrean Vault sits high in the mountains of Barovus, accessible only through a series of passes that are lethal to the unprepared.</strong> The journey from any settlement takes 4 travel segments — the longest overland route in the campaign. The passes are exposed, windswept, and bitterly cold. Acolytes suffer <strong>1d10 Energy damage (ignoring armour) per hour</strong> of exposure without adequate cold-weather gear. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Survival</strong> Test each hour reduces this damage by half. Appropriate cold-weather equipment (fur cloaks, thermal undersuits, void-suit heating elements) negates the damage entirely for the first 6 hours, after which the supernatural cold begins to overwhelm even the best gear (half damage thereafter).</p>\n<p>The passes are patrolled by <strong>Vault Guardian constructs</strong>: xenos automatons still functioning on degraded power cells after millennia. Use modified Combat Servitor profiles with las-weapons (40m, S/2/—, 1d10+4 E, Pen 2) and force-field generators (Protection Rating 30). They attack anything that approaches without authorisation — and the only being who ever had authorisation was Strahd, centuries ago. There are 2d5 guardians scattered along the approach, typically encountered in pairs.</p>\n<p>Avalanche risk is present on two sections of the approach. The GM should call for a <strong>Challenging (+0) Awareness</strong> Test to detect warning signs (cracking ice, shifting snowpack). If an avalanche triggers, all Acolytes must pass a <strong>Hard (−20) Agility</strong> Test or suffer 3d10 I damage and be buried (requiring a <strong>Challenging (+0) Strength</strong> Test or outside assistance to dig free; buried Acolytes suffer suffocation rules).</p>\n\n<h3>B2. The Entry Hall</h3>\n<p><strong>The twenty-metre door opens into a chamber of staggering scale: a vaulted hall at least fifty metres long and thirty metres high, carved from the same alien material as the door.</strong> The walls curve in ways that defy Euclidean geometry — corners that should be ninety degrees are slightly more or slightly less, and the effect is subtly nauseating. Alien script covers every surface, pulsing with a faint bioluminescence that provides dim illumination in shades of blue-white.</p>\n<p>At the far end of the hall, a flickering hololithic projection manifests when the Acolytes enter: the <strong>Vault Guardian AI</strong>. It is a vaguely humanoid figure, approximately three metres tall, composed of shifting geometric shapes. It speaks in halting, corrupted Low Gothic — learned from Strahd’s visit centuries ago — and its voice echoes with harmonic undertones that suggest the original language was far more complex.</p>\n<p>The AI addresses the Acolytes as “specimens” or “subjects” and asks their purpose. It has lost most of its memory and function but can provide fragmentary information about the Vault’s layout, the nature of the bound entities, and the history of Strahd’s visit. Treating it with patience and respect (<strong>Challenging (+0) Fellowship</strong> Tests) yields better information than threats. Key information the AI can provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Vault contains “many dozens” of containment cells; most remain sealed and functional</li>\n<li>Five cells are accessible and contain entities that “actively communicate”</li>\n<li>One cell — “designation Alpha-Prime” — has suffered “catastrophic containment failure”</li>\n<li>A “subject” matching Strahd’s description visited “a significant duration ago” and “breached protocol”</li>\n<li>The AI cannot prevent the Acolytes from entering any area but warns that “interaction with contained specimens is inadvisable for species of your psychic tolerance”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>B3. The Containment Corridor (Level 2)</h3>\n<p><strong>Below the entry hall, a spiralling ramp descends into the mountain’s heart.</strong> The temperature drops further with each level. The whispers grow louder. The corridor branches into individual cell antechambers, each sealed by a shimmering energy barrier of psycho-reactive material that dampens the entity within. The barriers are translucent: the Acolytes can see <em>something</em> moving behind each one, but the shapes refuse to resolve into anything comprehensible.</p>\n<p>Simply passing a cell requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Willpower</strong> Test. Failure means the Acolyte stops to listen. Stopping to listen requires a <strong>Hard (−20) Willpower</strong> Test to resist accepting the pact offered. The GM should roleplay each entity’s offer with maximum persuasive force — these are ancient, intelligent beings that have had millennia to perfect their pitch. They know the Acolytes’ names. They know their fears. They know exactly what each one needs most desperately.</p>\n<p>The five accessible containment cells are detailed in the <strong>Daemon Pacts</strong> page. Cell Alpha-Prime is on Level 3.</p>\n\n<h3>B4. The Central Nexus (Level 2)</h3>\n<p><strong>At the hub of the containment corridor, a circular chamber serves as the Vault’s operational centre.</strong> Alien control surfaces — smooth, organic panels that respond to touch with ripples of light — line the walls. Most are non-functional. A few still display information in the xenos script, which can be partially translated with a <strong>Very Hard (−30) Forbidden Lore (Xenos)</strong> Test. Successful translation reveals containment status readouts: most cells are listed as “STABLE / DEGRADING”, a few as “CRITICAL”, and one — Alpha-Prime — as “BREACHED / SUBJECT ABSENT.”</p>\n<p>The nexus also contains physical storage: xenos containers holding tools, components, and materials of uncertain purpose. Among the alien detritus, Acolytes who search (<strong>Hard (−20) Search</strong>) may find relics of previous human visitors — an Inquisitorial rosette from an operative who came centuries ago and never left, corroded data-slates with partial records of earlier expeditions, and a hexagrammic ward amulet that still functions (+10 WP vs. daemonic psychic powers).</p>\n\n<h3>B5. Cell Alpha-Prime (Level 3)</h3>\n<p><strong>The deepest chamber in the Vault. The containment barrier is shattered — fragments of psycho-reactive material litter the floor like broken stained glass, still faintly glowing.</strong> The cell itself is empty. The daemon that was held here is gone, claimed by a pact fulfilled centuries ago. But the cell is far from inert.</p>\n<p>Touching the walls triggers a <strong>sensory flashback</strong> to the moment of Strahd’s pact. All Acolytes within the cell experience it simultaneously: a vision of Strahd as he was — younger, still human, still a proud Imperial officer — standing before a manifestation of the Daemon Prince of Slaanesh. The vision reveals three critical pieces of intelligence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Daemon Prince’s name</strong> — knowing a daemon’s true name grants power over it but draws its attention. Gain <strong>1d5 Corruption Points</strong> from the knowledge alone. The name can be used in Act IV to disrupt Strahd’s connection to the Daemon Prince during the final confrontation.</li>\n<li><strong>The pact’s terms</strong> — Strahd received immortality, psychic dominion over Barovus, and the warp rift that seals his domain. In exchange, the Daemon Prince feeds on the psychic suffering of Barovus’s entire population, channelled through Strahd as a conduit, for eternity.</li>\n<li><strong>The pact’s weakness</strong> — the pact is anchored to Strahd’s soul. Destroying his physical form is insufficient; his soul reforms. The pact must be severed at its source. This requires <strong>three conditions</strong>: the relic power sword <strong>Dawn’s Edge</strong> (sanctified to sever warp-pacts) must strike the killing blow; the <strong>Rosette of Saint Markovia</strong> must be active and in proximity (suppressing his regeneration and warp-phase abilities); and the <strong>Heart of the Spire</strong> — the warp-crystal sustaining his fortress — must be destroyed first, severing his lair’s power.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the campaign’s central revelation. The Acolytes now know what they need and, in broad terms, where to find it. The Alpha-Prime vision also inflicts <strong>2d10 Insanity Points</strong> on all who witness it (reduced to 1d10 on a successful <strong>Hard (−20) Willpower</strong> Test) — the psychic imprint of a Daemon Prince’s presence is not something mortal minds process cleanly.</p>\n\n<h3>B6. Kasimir’s Objective — Cell Kappa-4</h3>\n<p><strong>A sealed containment cell on Level 2, indistinguishable from the others except that Kasimir has spent decades studying it from the outside.</strong> The entity within claims it can raise the dead. It can. Kasimir’s sister Patrina was murdered, and he believes this entity is his only hope of restoring her. He is correct about the entity’s capability. He is catastrophically wrong about the cost.</p>\n<p>If the Acolytes help Kasimir access the cell, the entity raises Patrina — but she returns as a <strong>warp-tainted being</strong>: beautiful, powerful, and utterly corrupted. She possesses Psy Rating 4 and knowledge of the Vault’s secrets, making her a valuable but deeply dangerous potential ally. She may serve the Acolytes’ interests, or she may serve Strahd’s, or she may serve only herself. Kasimir, blinded by love and guilt, cannot see what she has become.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>NPCs and Encounters</h2>\n\n<h3>Kasimir Velikov — The Penitent Scholar</h3>\n<p>Kasimir is a tall, gaunt figure with an air of exhausted obsession. He has spent decades studying the Empyrean Vault from the outside, mapping its approach routes, cataloguing the xenos script on its exterior, and listening to the whispers that carry on the mountain wind. He approaches the Acolytes with a desperate bargain: he will guide them to the Vault — providing <strong>+20 to Navigation tests</strong> on the approach and <strong>+20 to Forbidden Lore (Xenos) tests</strong> within the Vault — if they help him access Cell Kappa-4 and resurrect his sister.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Interaction:</strong> Kasimir is not a villain. He is a grief-stricken scholar who has convinced himself that the end justifies the means. He is honest about the Vault’s dangers (he has seen others die on the approach), helpful with xenos lore, and genuinely grateful for the Acolytes’ assistance. He is also in denial about the cost of the resurrection. If the Acolytes attempt to dissuade him, he resists with increasing desperation (<strong>Opposed Willpower</strong> Tests; his WP is 55, and his conviction is absolute). If they physically prevent him from reaching Cell Kappa-4, he becomes hostile — not violently (he is no warrior) but diplomatically: he withdraws his guidance, potentially sabotages their navigation, and may attempt to return to the Vault alone.</p>\n<p><strong>If Kasimir succeeds:</strong> Patrina returns. She is lucid, articulate, and grateful — and she radiates a faint warp-taint that any psyker or Acolyte with Psyniscience can detect (<strong>Ordinary (+10) Psyniscience</strong>). She possesses knowledge of the Vault’s deeper secrets and can provide +10 to tests related to the containment cells and their entities. She is also a potential long-term threat: in Act III or IV, she may attempt to claim power for herself, betray the Acolytes to Strahd in exchange for dominion over Berez, or simply disappear into the Vault to continue her own research. The GM should treat Patrina as a ticking time bomb whose detonation timing is a narrative choice.</p>\n\n<h3>The Vault Guardian AI</h3>\n<p>The fragmentary intelligence that once managed the containment facility. It manifests as a flickering hololithic figure in the entry hall and occasionally in the central nexus. It is not hostile but is deeply confused by the passage of time and the degradation of its own memory. It refers to the bound entities as “specimens” and to the Acolytes as “unauthorised biological subjects.”</p>\n<p><strong>Information the AI can provide</strong> (each requires a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Fellowship</strong> Test, representing patient, respectful communication):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General layout of the Vault (grants +10 to Navigate tests within the facility)</li>\n<li>The nature of the containment system (psycho-reactive wards that dampen warp energy; they are failing)</li>\n<li>Confirmation that “Specimen Alpha-Prime” escaped its containment via “an external catalyst” (Strahd)</li>\n<li>A partial list of the other contained entities and their “risk classifications” (Tzeentch: “Psychic Hazard, Class VII”; Nurgle: “Biological Hazard, Class V”; Khorne: “Kinetic Hazard, Class IX”; Slaanesh: “Memetic Hazard, Class VIII”; Unknown: “Classification Error / Data Corrupt”)</li>\n<li>A warning that “interaction with specimens accelerates containment degradation” — each pact accepted weakens the facility further</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Vault Guardian Constructs</h3>\n<p><strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Challenging | <strong>Wounds:</strong> 20 | <strong>AP:</strong> 6 (xenos alloy) | <strong>Protection Rating:</strong> 30 (force field)</p>\n<p>Automated xenos security drones that patrol the mountain approach and, less frequently, the interior corridors. They resemble angular, insectoid forms approximately 1.5 metres tall, hovering on anti-grav units. Their weapons are las-based but of alien design (40m, S/2/—, 1d10+4 E, Pen 2). Their force fields are their primary defence: any hit must first overcome the Protection Rating (roll d100; if the roll is equal to or under 30, the shot is deflected entirely). They are <strong>not</strong> warp entities and are unaffected by blessed weapons or psychic attacks — they are purely technological, albeit of alien technology.</p>\n<p>On the approach: 2d5 constructs total, encountered in pairs. Inside the Vault: 1d5 constructs patrol the corridors on a random schedule (encounter check every 30 minutes of exploration; constructs appear on a roll of 1–25 on d100).</p>\n\n<h3>Encounter: The Gauntlet of Whispers</h3>\n<p>As the Acolytes traverse the containment corridor on Level 2, each cell they pass constitutes an encounter. The bound entities are aware of the Acolytes’ presence and tailor their psychic lures to each individual. The GM should describe the sensations each Acolyte experiences as they pass each cell:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cell Sigma-3 (Tzeentch):</strong> The Acolyte sees visions of perfect tactical clarity — Strahd’s weaknesses laid bare, every trap in the Spire revealed, every enemy’s position known. Knowledge without limit. Understanding without effort.</li>\n<li><strong>Cell Theta-7 (Nurgle):</strong> The Acolyte feels their wounds close, their fatigue lift, their body surge with vitality. The promise of never being hurt again. Never being sick. Never dying. Comfort. Peace. Endurance.</li>\n<li><strong>Cell Omega-1 (Khorne):</strong> The Acolyte’s blood sings with power. Their arms feel stronger, their reflexes sharper, their instincts honed to a killing edge. The certainty that no enemy could stand before them. That they could cut their way through Strahd’s army single-handed.</li>\n<li><strong>Cell Phi-9 (Slaanesh):</strong> The Acolyte hears their name whispered with adoration. They feel understood, desired, valued. The power to make others see them as they wish to be seen. To command loyalty, devotion, obedience — simply by willing it.</li>\n<li><strong>Cell Lambda-12 (Unknown):</strong> Silence. A profound, absolute absence of sensation. Then a single thought, not the Acolyte’s own: <em>You could live forever. You could outlast everything. Even him.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each lure requires the Willpower tests described above. The GM should personalise the offers further based on each Acolyte’s background, flaws, and current situation — a wounded Acolyte is more susceptible to Nurgle’s offer, a frustrated commander to Tzeentch’s, a grieving one to the Unknown’s.</p>"

The Vault’s xenos wards, even in their degraded state, partially block his psychic surveillance.</p>\n<p>This means the Acolytes are, for the first and possibly only time in the campaign, <strong>genuinely beyond Strahd’s observation</strong>. They can plan, discuss, and make decisions without his knowledge. This should feel both liberating and deeply unsettling — the absence of his attention is itself a kind of horror, because it means even the master of Barovus fears something about this place.</p>\n<p>However, if any Acolyte <strong>accepts a Slaanesh pact</strong> (Cell Phi-9), Strahd can sense that Acolyte’s location at all times thereafter, even within the Vault. The Acolyte has, in accepting the pact, tuned themselves to the same warp-frequency as Strahd’s own connection. He will know. And he will be <em>very</em> interested.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Daemon Pacts — The Containment Cells</h2>\n\n<p>Each of the five accessible containment cells holds a bound warp entity that actively offers a pact to any mortal who stops to listen. The pacts are real: the benefits are genuine and immediate, and the costs are severe and permanent. The Game Master should roleplay each entity’s offer with maximum persuasiveness. These are ancient, intelligent beings that have had millennia to refine their approach. They do not threaten. They do not bluster. They simply offer exactly what the Acolyte needs most, in exactly the terms they are most likely to accept.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mechanical Framework:</strong> Any Acolyte who accepts a pact gains the listed benefits immediately. Corruption Points are applied immediately and may trigger mutations (roll on the Mutation Table if the Acolyte’s total Corruption exceeds their Willpower Bonus × 10). The accepting Acolyte also gains a <strong>Secret Condition</strong>: a behavioural compulsion known only to the accepting player and the GM. This condition creates tension and roleplay opportunities for the remainder of the campaign.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cell Sigma-3 — “The Whispered Answer” (Daemon of Tzeentch)</h3>\n<p><em>The air shimmers behind the barrier. A voice like rustling parchment speaks from everywhere and nowhere, finishing the Acolyte’s thoughts before they form. It knows their name. It knows their mission. It knows what they do not.</em></p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Offer</strong></td><td><strong>Knowledge.</strong> The entity reveals the complete layout of the Zarovich Spire, including all traps, guard positions, secret passages, and the locations of the Heart of the Spire and Strahd’s coffin. The Acolyte retains this information as perfect, eidetic recall.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Corruption Cost</strong></td><td><strong>2d10 Corruption Points</strong></td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Additional Cost — Mutation</strong></td><td>The Acolyte gains one <strong>Minor Mutation</strong> (roll on the Mutation Table)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Secret Condition</strong></td><td><strong>Compulsive Curiosity.</strong> The Acolyte must pass a <strong>Willpower Test at −20</strong> to resist investigating any anomalous phenomenon, forbidden text, sealed door, or unknown signal they encounter. Failure means they <em>must</em> investigate, regardless of tactical considerations or party consensus.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This pact has the highest tactical value for the party and the lowest apparent immediate cost. The Spire intelligence is genuinely accurate and saves the Acolytes potentially lethal trial-and-error in Act III. The compulsion, however, will drive the Acolyte into dangerous situations repeatedly — especially within the Spire itself, where curiosity can be fatal.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cell Theta-7 — “The Undying Gift” (Daemon of Nurgle)</h3>\n<p><em>Warmth seeps through the barrier. Not the warmth of fire but the warmth of a body, of a fever, of life refusing to end. The Acolyte’s aches fade. Old scars tingle. A voice like a grandfather’s murmur promises that pain is simply a problem that has already been solved.</em></p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Offer</strong></td><td><strong>Resilience.</strong> The Acolyte gains the <strong>Regeneration (5)</strong> trait and becomes completely immune to disease and poison.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Corruption Cost</strong></td><td><strong>2d10 Corruption Points</strong></td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Additional Cost — Physical</strong></td><td>The Acolyte’s flesh becomes grey and numb. <strong>Reduce Fellowship by 15.</strong> They exude a faint aura of decay: <strong>−10 to all social interactions</strong> with non-corrupted individuals.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Secret Condition</strong></td><td><strong>Acceptance of Decay.</strong> The Acolyte becomes subtly indifferent to suffering — their own and others’. They must pass a <strong>Willpower Test at −10</strong> to provide urgent medical aid, rush to a fallen comrade, or prioritise healing over other actions. Pain and death begin to feel … natural.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Regeneration (5) is enormously powerful in a campaign where medical supplies are scarce. The Fellowship reduction and social penalty make the Acolyte increasingly isolated from allies and NPCs. The secret condition subtly undermines team cohesion as the Acolyte becomes less responsive to emergencies.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cell Omega-1 — “The Red Blessing” (Daemon of Khorne)</h3>\n<p><em>The barrier pulses like a heartbeat. The Acolyte’s pulse synchronises with it. Their muscles tense. Their hands flex. A wordless roar of exultation echoes through their skull, and for one perfect instant they feel what it would be like to be the strongest thing in any room they enter. The entity does not speak in words. It speaks in the language of adrenaline, sinew, and broken bones.</em></p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Offer</strong></td><td><strong>Martial Fury.</strong> The Acolyte gains <strong>+20 to Weapon Skill, +2 to Strength Bonus</strong>, and the <strong>Frenzy</strong> talent (if not already possessed).</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Corruption Cost</strong></td><td><strong>2d10 Corruption Points</strong></td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Additional Cost — Physical</strong></td><td>The Acolyte’s eyes permanently burn with a faint red glow, visible in low light. This is immediately noticeable and unsettling to anyone who sees them.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Secret Condition</strong></td><td><strong>Blood Compulsion.</strong> When the Acolyte witnesses violence — any violence, including combat initiated by allies — they must pass a <strong>Willpower Test at −10</strong> or be compelled to join the fight with melee attacks, prioritising the nearest target regardless of allegiance. This includes brawls, executions, training sparring, and even animal fights.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The raw combat statistics are significant — +20 WS and +2 SB transforms a mediocre combatant into a formidable one. The compulsion is the trap: in a campaign with frequent violence, the Acolyte will regularly lose control. Friendly fire incidents are nearly inevitable, and the red glow makes it impossible to hide what they have become from observant NPCs.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cell Phi-9 — “The Perfect Moment” (Daemon of Slaanesh)</h3>\n<p><em>The barrier does not shimmer or pulse. It sings. A single, sustained note of such exquisite beauty that it bypasses the ears entirely and resonates in the Acolyte’s soul. The entity’s voice is warm, intimate, knowing. It uses the Acolyte’s name like a caress. It speaks of understanding, of being truly seen, of the loneliness of duty and the sweetness of being obeyed.</em></p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Offer</strong></td><td><strong>Domination.</strong> The Acolyte gains a psychic ability equivalent to the <strong>Dominate</strong> power (Willpower Test, range 20m, target obeys a single command). This works even on non-psykers. The Acolyte does not need to be a psyker to use this ability.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Corruption Cost</strong></td><td><strong>3d10 Corruption Points</strong> — the highest cost among the four named daemons. Slaanesh’s gifts are the most expensive on a world already saturated with Slaaneshi influence.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Additional Cost — Surveillance</strong></td><td><strong>Strahd can sense the Acolyte’s location at all times</strong> — the Acolyte has tuned to the same warp-frequency as Strahd’s pact. This is not detectable by the Acolyte. They will not know Strahd can track them until it becomes apparent through his actions.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Secret Condition</strong></td><td><strong>Addiction to Control.</strong> The Acolyte must pass a <strong>Willpower Test at −20</strong> to resist using Dominate in any social confrontation — negotiations, arguments, interrogations, even disagreements with allies. The sensation of imposing their will on another is intoxicating, and each use makes the next resistance harder (−5 cumulative penalty per use).</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the most insidious pact. The Dominate ability is extraordinarily useful in a campaign heavy with social encounters and NPC manipulation. The 3d10 CP cost is potentially campaign-ending (an unlucky roll could push an Acolyte past the 100 CP threshold immediately). The surveillance cost is the true danger: Strahd gains perfect intelligence on one member of the party at all times, which he will use to devastating effect in Act III. The escalating Willpower penalty means the Acolyte will eventually be unable to resist using the power, turning every social interaction into an act of psychic domination.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cell Lambda-12 — “The Hollow Crown” (Unknown Entity)</h3>\n<p><em>There is nothing behind this barrier. No light, no sound, no presence. Only void. And then, between one heartbeat and the next, a thought that is not the Acolyte’s own: a vast, patient, ancient intelligence that has waited longer than star-systems for someone to ask the right question. It does not offer. It simply states a fact: you will die. Everything you love will die. Unless.</em></p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Offer</strong></td><td><strong>Immortality.</strong> The Acolyte ceases to age and gains the <strong>Undying</strong> trait: they cannot be killed by normal means. When reduced to 0 Wounds, the Acolyte’s body regenerates over 1d5 hours, returning to full Wounds. Only weapons specifically consecrated to sever warp-pacts (Dawn’s Edge) can permanently kill them.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Corruption Cost</strong></td><td><strong>3d10 Corruption Points</strong></td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Additional Cost — Binding</strong></td><td><strong>The Acolyte’s soul is bound to Barovus.</strong> They can never leave, even if the warp rift is closed. If the campaign ends with the rift collapsing, this Acolyte does not escape. They remain, alone, on a world that may or may not survive.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Secret Condition</strong></td><td><strong>Erosion of Identity.</strong> The entity’s voice persists in the Acolyte’s mind, growing louder in moments of weakness (when Wounded, fatigued, or emotionally distressed). It does not command — it suggests, questions, undermines. <em>“Why do you serve them? They will forget you. I will not.”</em> The Acolyte must pass a <strong>Willpower Test at −10</strong> (increasing by −5 each subsequent time) or act on the entity’s suggestion for 1 round.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the most narratively devastating pact. The Undying trait makes the Acolyte nearly unkillable, which is enormously powerful in the short term. The soul-binding means there is no happy ending for this character — they have traded escape for survival, which is the central tragic bargain of Barovus itself. The identity erosion provides a slow-burn horror arc as the Acolyte gradually becomes less themselves and more … something else. The entity’s nature is deliberately left undefined; the GM may decide it is a C’tan shard, a fragment of a deceased Chaos God, an Old One remnant, or something entirely novel.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cell Alpha-Prime — Strahd’s Pact Site (No Pact Available)</h3>\n<p><em>This cell is open. The barrier is shattered. What was held here is gone, released into the world centuries ago. But the walls remember.</em></p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Entity</strong></td><td>None present. Formerly contained a <strong>Daemon Prince of Slaanesh</strong>, now bound to Strahd’s pact and feeding on Barovus’s suffering.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Revelation</strong></td><td>Touching the walls triggers a psychic flashback. All Acolytes within the cell witness Strahd’s pact. Three critical facts are revealed: the Daemon Prince’s true name (1d5 CP to learn), the pact’s terms (immortality and dominion in exchange for a world’s suffering), and the <strong>three destruction conditions</strong> (Dawn’s Edge must strike the killing blow, Rosette of Saint Markovia must be active, Heart of the Spire must be destroyed first).</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Insanity Cost</strong></td><td><strong>2d10 Insanity Points</strong> (reduced to 1d10 on a successful <strong>Hard (−20) Willpower</strong> Test)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Corruption Cost</strong></td><td><strong>1d5 Corruption Points</strong> (from learning the Daemon Prince’s name)</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the single most important room in the Empyrean Vault and arguably in the entire campaign. The information here transforms the Acolytes’ mission from “survive and escape” to “here is exactly what you need to do.” The destruction conditions give the party a concrete checklist for Act III: find Dawn’s Edge, find the Rosette, infiltrate the Spire, destroy the Heart, confront Strahd. Without this intelligence, the Acolytes are guessing. With it, they have a plan. The IP cost is high but appropriate — witnessing the psychic echo of a Daemon Prince’s manifestation should leave scars. The Daemon Prince’s name can be used in Act IV to disrupt Strahd’s regeneration for 1d5 rounds during the final battle (a <strong>Very Hard (−30) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology)</strong> Test to invoke it correctly), making it a valuable but dangerous asset.</p>"

It is the final destination of every road, the culmination of every rumour, and the singular purpose behind every prayer whispered in the dark. The Spire is not merely Strahd's home &mdash; it <em>is</em> Strahd, in a very real and terrible sense. The warp rift that imprisons Barovus has its nexus here, threaded through the castle's foundations like a tumour woven into living tissue. The fortress responds to Strahd's psyche: his moods shape its corridors, his rage shakes its stones, his hunger opens its doors.</p>\n<p>The Game Master must internalise the cardinal rule of this dungeon: <strong>the Acolytes are mice in Strahd's game.</strong> They are not clearing rooms and marking them safe. They are surviving. Every moment of calm is a moment Strahd has permitted. Every discovery is something he wanted them to find &mdash; or something they found in spite of him. Within the Spire, Strahd has absolute awareness through scrying-servitors embedded in the walls (requiring a <em>Hard (&ndash;20) Awareness</em> test to notice), warp-sight that lets him sense living souls, and a network of hidden passages threaded through the castle's bones. He knows where the Acolytes are at all times.</p>\n<p>The castle is alive. Its walls breathe with a faint rhythmic expansion visible only in peripheral vision. Its shadows move independently of light sources. Its corridors rearrange when the Acolytes are not looking &mdash; a <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Navigate (Surface)</em> test is required to maintain bearings; failure means the party ends up somewhere unintended. Vox-casters embedded in the walls crackle with Strahd's voice, the screams of long-dead victims, or a subsonic hum that sets teeth on edge. The temperature fluctuates wildly, and the stone itself is warm to the touch in places, as though the castle has a pulse. The Acolytes should never feel in control until Strahd is destroyed or they flee.</p>"

What follows is a condensed overview; the full room-by-room detail is found in the Act III design document.</p>\n<h3>Courtyard and Approach (Map 11a)</h3>\n<p>The road to the Spire is a demoralising climb past thirty-seven defaced saint-statues with inverted aquilas and blasphemous catechisms &mdash; a <em>Routine (+20) Willpower</em> test upon first sight of the Spire prevents a creeping sense of wrongness. The drawbridge lowers automatically when the Acolytes come within fifty metres, controlled solely by Strahd's will. The chasm beneath is ninety metres deep, ending in a pool of liquefied warp-stuff (instantly fatal; <em>Very Hard (&ndash;30) Willpower</em> test or gain <em>1d10 Corruption Points</em> during the fall). Beyond the drawbridge, a warp-forged iron portcullis and massive adamantium doors swing open without force.</p>\n<p>The <strong>courtyard</strong> is an eighty-metre-square killing ground enclosed by curtain walls. Key features include: <strong>The Dead Gardens</strong> &mdash; topiary shapes that are actually chem-preserved corpses of former servants, posed in attitudes of service (<em>Ordinary (+10) Medicae</em> or <em>Awareness</em> to recognise); <strong>The Fountain</strong> &mdash; the von Zarovich crest, basin stained with old blood, touching it triggers a psychic flash of a blood-drinking gala; <strong>Strahd's Carriage</strong> &mdash; a bespoke tracked vehicle with a bound warp-entity for a machine-spirit (WP 55 to control); and <strong>Gargoyle-Servitors</strong> &mdash; forty to sixty dormant stone-like constructs perched on every parapet, indistinguishable from decoration until activated.</p>\n<p><strong>Entry Points:</strong> Main entrance (drawbridge and gates), a servant's door in the east curtain wall (<em>Hard (&ndash;20) Security</em> to locate), and a drainage grate beneath the courtyard (<em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Awareness</em> to find, leads to the crypts via flooded tunnels).</p>\n<h3>Ground Level (Map 11b)</h3>\n<p>The ground level is the public face of the Spire &mdash; faded Imperial grandeur rotting from within.</p>\n<p><strong>The Grand Entry Hall</strong> is a cathedral-space soaring thirty metres high, with pillars of black granite carved with Strahd's conquests, six two-tonne crystal chandeliers (can be dropped: <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) BS</em> to sever chains, dealing <em>4d10+10 I</em> in a 4m radius, <em>Concussive (3)</em>), and a floor mosaic replacing the Emperor's face with Strahd's (<em>Ordinary (+10) Awareness</em> to notice; <em>Routine (+20) WP</em> or gain <em>1 Insanity Point</em>). Organ music drifts through the hall from the loft above.</p>\n<p><strong>The Dining Hall</strong> hosts the pivotal <strong>Dinner Invitation</strong> scene &mdash; a table set for exactly the Acolytes' number, with name cards in Strahd's elegant hand. The food is genuine, safe, and restores <em>1d5 Wounds</em> and removes one Fatigue. Strahd appears for dinner, offering polite conversation and a deal: leave Barovus, report it lost, and depart unharmed.</p>\n<p><strong>The Audience Chamber</strong> contains centuries of governance data-slates (searchable with <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Inquiry</em>; reveals the rift's exact date, Sergei's death warrant in Strahd's hand, and unanswered petitions for Imperial rescue) and twelve dormant <strong>servitor-guards</strong> (WS 40, BS 35, S 45 Unnatural x2, Wounds 20, AP 5, lascarbines and power mauls) that activate if the throne is approached.</p>\n<p><strong>The Chapel</strong> retains a ghost of its original sanctification: warp entities find it uncomfortable (Strahd's lair action resistance gains <em>+10</em>), faith powers function at <em>+10</em>, Corruption tests gain <em>+20</em>, and a perpetual candle burns that cannot be extinguished. An Acolyte who prays at the altar may make a <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Willpower</em> test to remove <em>1d5 Insanity Points</em> and restore <em>1d5 Wounds</em> (once per Acolyte). Dawn's Edge gains the <em>Sanctified</em> quality permanently if brought here.</p>\n<p><strong>Servant Quarters, Kitchen, and Guard Barracks</strong> round out the ground floor: thirty non-combat domestic servitors maintaining an empty household, a kitchen that replenishes itself via minor warp phenomena (eating for more than a week requires <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Toughness</em> or gain <em>1 Corruption Point</em>), and barracks housing twelve <strong>warp-thralls</strong> in dormant state who attack in coordinated PDF squad tactics when activated.</p>\n<h3>Upper Levels (Map 11c)</h3>\n<p>The upper levels contain the Spire's most personal and most dangerous spaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Strahd's Study</strong> is the most human room in the fortress &mdash; a warm, book-lined chamber with a genuine fire, a half-finished glass of wine, and a portrait of Sergei that radiates faint psychic warmth. The <strong>Tome of Strahd</strong> (encrypted data-cogitator, <em>Hard (&ndash;20) Tech-Use</em> or <em>Ciphers</em> to decrypt) sits on a side table. It contains four centuries of diary entries revealing Strahd's full history, the terms of his pact with the Daemon Prince <strong>Tenebrous</strong>, the Tatyana reincarnation cycle, and the three conditions for his permanent destruction. The bookshelves yield a <em>+20 bonus</em> to a single <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp)</em> test with a successful <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Scholastic Lore (Occult)</em> search.</p>\n<p><strong>The Organ Loft</strong> overlooks the grand hall. A servitor hardwired into the pipe organ has played the Ecclesiarchy hymn \"The Emperor's Light Endures\" for over two hundred years. Playing the organ with <em>Trade (Musician)</em> or <em>Performer</em> produces warp-resonant effects: an Imperial hymn stuns warp-thralls and disorients Strahd (<em>&ndash;10 all tests, 1d5 rounds</em>); a piece of sorrow unlocks doors and makes spirits visible; a discordant piece triggers <em>1d5 Corruption Points</em> and warp anomalies.</p>\n<p><strong>The Guest Quarters</strong> are genuinely comfortable and safe &mdash; Strahd's word holds here. No traps, no surveillance. Resting six hours removes all Fatigue and heals normally. The comfort is the insult.</p>\n<p><strong>The North Tower (Observatory)</strong> contains star-charts of the warp rift's interior (studying them: <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) WP</em> or <em>1 Insanity Point</em>) and a cogitator with navigational data (<em>Hard (&ndash;20) Forbidden Lore (Warp)</em> to interpret) revealing the rift is artificial, anchored to the Heart, Strahd's will, and Sergei's remains, and expanding toward the nearest Imperial system.</p>\n<p><strong>The South Tower</strong> is where Tatyana fell. The psychic imprint is seared into the warp-stuff: psykers must pass <em>Hard (&ndash;20) WP</em> or experience a devastating vision of Tatyana's final moments (<em>1d5 Insanity Points, 1 Corruption Point</em>), but gain understanding that may grant <em>+10</em> to social tests against Strahd.</p>\n<h3>The Crypts (Map 11d)</h3>\n<p>Beneath the Spire, a labyrinthine network of corridors and burial vaults extends far beyond the castle's footprint &mdash; a spatial impossibility enabled by the warp rift. Navigation is <em>Hard (&ndash;20)</em>. All light sources have halved range. Fear resistance suffers <em>&ndash;10</em>. Temperature is &ndash;5&deg;C (Fatigue from cold after 2 hours without gear, <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Toughness</em> per hour).</p>\n<p>Ten named crypts are detailed in the <strong>Heart and Crypts</strong> page. Of particular note: <strong>Sergei's tomb</strong> (incorrupt body, possible Dawn's Edge location, spirit offers blessing of <em>+10 WP vs. Strahd</em>), <strong>Strahd's coffin</strong> (deepest chamber, behind a false wall, guarded by six warp-thralls), <strong>Ireena's prepared crypt</strong> (empty sarcophagus with wedding veil &mdash; pure horror, no combat), and the <strong>Chained Daemon</strong> (a lesser Slaaneshi daemon offering accurate information for release at a cost of <em>2d10 Corruption Points</em>).</p>\n<p>Seven <strong>teleportation braziers</strong> form a rapid-transit network throughout the Spire (see Heart and Crypts page for details).</p>\n<h3>Heart Chamber (Map 11e)</h3>\n<p>Behind three successive warded doors, a spherical chamber thirty metres in diameter contains the <strong>Heart of the Spire</strong> &mdash; a metre-wide crystal of solidified warp energy, pulsing with Strahd's own heartbeat, suspended in crackling warp-lightning. Two bound <strong>Warp Stalkers</strong> (lesser daemons of Slaanesh) serve as eternal sentinels. The Heart's destruction is one of three conditions for permanently killing Strahd and triggers catastrophic effects: castle-wide earthquake, Strahd's frenzied response, destabilisation of the Spire's architecture, and stunned warp-touched creatures throughout the fortress. Full mechanics are detailed in the Heart and Crypts page.</p>"

If five or more are destroyed, survivors fall back to the crypts to defend the coffin.</p>\n<h3>The Organ Servitor</h3>\n<p>A once-talented human musician hardwired into the massive pipe organ for over two hundred years, playing the Ecclesiarchy hymn \"The Emperor's Light Endures\" on infinite loop. Biological components are sustained by nutrient feeds; cybernetic components maintained by the castle's systems. It is not hostile and cannot be reasoned with &mdash; it is less a person than a component of the instrument. The music is genuinely beautiful, even holy, and fills the entire ground level. An Acolyte who recognises the hymn (<em>Routine (+20) Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed)</em>) may find brief, unsettling comfort in it.</p>\n<h3>Cyrus Belview (Mongrelfolk Servant)</h3>\n<p>A pitiable creature found in the servant quarters &mdash; one of the castle's longer-surviving mongrelfolk attendants, kept by Strahd as a curiosity. Cyrus is grotesquely mutated but retains a childlike personality and a desperate desire to please. He can serve as an informant if the Acolytes treat him with kindness: he knows the layout of the ground level and crypts, the locations of several traps, the routines of the warp-thrall patrols, and the fact that \"the master goes to the deep room when he is hurt\" (Strahd's coffin). He is terrified of Strahd and will not act against him openly but can be persuaded to leave doors unlocked or deliver messages. A <em>Routine (+20) Fellowship</em> test earns his cooperation; cruelty sends him fleeing to alert Strahd.</p>\n<h3>Rahadin (Strahd's Seneschal)</h3>\n<p>Strahd's right-hand &mdash; an elite combatant who has served the von Zarovich household for centuries. Rahadin is utterly loyal, coldly efficient, and surrounded by a psychic aura of screaming: the death-screams of every person he has killed, echoing perpetually around him. All characters within 10 metres must pass a <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Willpower</em> test each round or suffer <em>&ndash;10 to all tests</em> from the psychic noise. He is encountered patrolling the upper levels or guarding the approach to the Heart Chamber. He does not negotiate, does not bluff, and does not retreat. He fights with twin power blades and preternatural speed. WS 60, BS 50, S 45, T 45, Ag 55, WP 50, Wounds 30, AP 5 All, twin power swords (1d10+7 E each, Pen 5, Balanced). Talents include Lightning Attack, Swift Attack, Step Aside, Counter-Attack, and Combat Master. Threat Rating: Dangerous.</p>\n<h3>Random Encounters</h3>\n<p>Roll <em>1d10</em> every hour of in-game exploration (every 30 minutes after the Heart is destroyed). Results range from warp-thrall patrols and malfunctioning servitors to warp anomalies, Strahd's taunting vox-messages, warp-vermin swarms, spirits of past victims, castle reconfigurations, a desperate thrall named Doru who retains fragments of humanity (but may revert to Strahd's control every 10 minutes &mdash; WP 25 test), and Strahd himself appearing to observe or attack depending on his current phase.</p>"

The Emperor's Tarot reading from Act I determines where each is found &mdash; one or more may be located within the Spire itself (Dawn's Edge in Sergei's tomb, the Rosette in the crypts, the Tome in Strahd's study). The Acolytes' primary objectives within the Spire are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Recover the Tome of Strahd to learn the three conditions for permanent destruction.</li>\n<li>Destroy the Heart of the Spire (Heart Chamber, Map 11e).</li>\n<li>Find and destroy or sanctify Strahd's coffin (deepest crypt, Map 11d).</li>\n<li>Strike Strahd down with Dawn's Edge while the Rosette is active and both the Heart and coffin are neutralised.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Strahd's Tactics</h3>\n<p><strong>When he engages:</strong> Strahd singles out the most martially skilled Acolyte for duelling, uses lair actions to control the battlefield, and directs minions with <em>+10</em> to all their tests. He parries with contemptuous ease (Parry 75) and ripostes with lethal precision.</p>\n<p><strong>When he withdraws:</strong> Strahd phases through walls to reposition, retreats to his coffin to regenerate (1d10 hours, or 1d5 if the Heart is intact), and redeploys forces between forays. Each time the Acolytes re-enter the Spire, he has adapted: repositioned forces, reset traps, adjusted strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>How he uses the lair:</strong> Strahd separates the party through architecture, funnels them into ambushes, blocks escape routes, and creates environmental hazards. He extinguishes lights, seals rooms, and summons servitors at will. The castle is his weapon.</p>\n<h3>Lair Actions</h3>\n<p>Strahd may perform one Lair Action at Initiative 0 each round. These are not psychic powers &mdash; they require no test and cannot be resisted by conventional means. They are expressions of the castle as an extension of Strahd's will.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Lair Action</th><th>Effect</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Command the Castle</strong></td><td>Doors slam open/shut and lock (<em>Armour 8, SI 20</em> to force).

Agility Challenging (+0)</em> to avoid.</li>\n<li><strong>The Walls Close:</strong> Chamber physically contracts. All characters pushed <em>1d5m</em> toward centre. Characters pushed into walls suffer <em>1d10 I</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Floor of Madness:</strong> Floor becomes transparent, revealing raw warp beneath. <em>Challenging (+0) WP</em> or <em>1 Insanity Point</em> and Stunned 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>Douse the Lights:</strong> All artificial light dies.

Characters without Dark Sight suffer <em>&ndash;30 WS and BS</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Summon Thralls:</strong> <em>1d5</em> warp-thralls claw through walls/floor within 10m (WS 30, S 30, T 30, Wounds 8 &mdash; weak but serve as distractions).</li>\n<li><strong>The Spire Speaks:</strong> Strahd channels his voice through vox-systems. <em>Challenging (+0) WP</em> or <em>&ndash;10 to all tests</em> for 1 round as his words worm into their minds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Final Battle (Act IV Reference)</h3>\n<p>The final confrontation with Strahd is covered in full in Act IV. The battle location is determined by the Emperor's Tarot reading. Strahd fights in three phases:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Phase</th><th>Trigger</th><th>Key Changes</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Phase 1: The Lord-Governor</strong></td><td>Combat begins</td><td>WS 65, WP 70, 80 Wounds, Fear (3).

Escalated lair actions.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Phase 3: The Daemon Ascendant</strong></td><td>10 Wounds or fewer, coffin destroyed (optional phase)</td><td>Wounds restored to 40. Unnatural x3. Fear (5). Psy Rating 9. Daemonic trait. Loses 5 Wounds/turn (built-in 8-round timer). Daemon Prince manifests partially in the rift above.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Permanent destruction requires all three conditions simultaneously:</strong> Heart of the Spire destroyed, coffin destroyed or sanctified, and the killing blow struck by Dawn's Edge while the Rosette is active. If any condition is unmet, Strahd regenerates within 1d10 days.</p>"

The room is a sphere, thirty metres in diameter, carved from the living rock of the mountain. The walls are covered in script grown into the stone like veins in flesh, in no language any of you recognise. And at the centre of the sphere, suspended in empty air, turning slowly in a web of crackling warp-lightning, is the Heart. A crystal &mdash; a metre across, roughly spherical, translucent, pulsing with a deep arterial red light that throbs in time with a rhythm you can feel in your chest. It is, you realise with horror, a heartbeat. The castle's heartbeat. Strahd's heartbeat.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Heart of the Spire is the nexus of the warp rift's connection to the castle and, through the castle, to Strahd. It is the mechanism by which the pact's power is channelled into the physical world. Destroying it is one of the three conditions necessary to permanently kill Strahd.</p>\n<h3>The Warded Doors</h3>\n<p>Three successive doors guard the approach. Each is sealed with hexagrammic wards that inflict <em>2d10 Energy damage</em> (Pen 5, ignoring non-psychic armour) to any warp-touched entity that attempts to pass. Strahd can bypass them (keyed to him); his servants cannot. The wards do not affect untainted humans. Each door: <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Forbidden Lore (Warp)</em> or <em>Security</em> to open; alternatively, brute force (<em>Armour 10, Structural Integrity 35</em> per door).</p>\n<h3>Heart Profile</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Property</th><th>Value</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Structural Integrity</strong></td><td>50</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Armour</strong></td><td>8 (warp-infused crystal)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Resistance</strong></td><td>Immune to non-physical damage.

In the Heart Chamber itself: Regeneration increases to 2d10/round, Psy Rating +3, Damage Reduction 6.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Psychic Backlash When Struck</h3>\n<p>Each time the Heart takes damage, it lashes out with psychic feedback. Every character within 10 metres must pass a <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Willpower</em> test or suffer <em>1d5 Insanity Points</em>. The Heart also emits a pulse of warp energy that deals <em>1d10 E damage</em> (ignoring armour) to all non-warp-touched creatures in the chamber. All characters in the chamber suffer <em>1 Corruption Point per 10 rounds</em> of exposure (1 per 5 rounds if the Heart is damaged and leaking).</p>\n<h3>Guardians</h3>\n<p>Two <strong>Warp Stalkers</strong> &mdash; lesser daemons of Slaanesh, bound and chained to the chamber walls &mdash; are freed when anyone enters without Strahd's permission. They are fast, vicious, and fight to destroy anyone threatening the Heart.</p>\n<h3>Destroying the Heart</h3>\n<p>When the Heart is destroyed, the following effects trigger simultaneously:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Earthquake:</strong> The entire Spire shakes violently. All characters: <em>Ordinary (+10) Agility</em> test or knocked Prone.</li>\n<li><strong>Strahd's Scream:</strong> An agonised scream echoes through the entire castle, inflicting <em>1d5 Insanity Points</em> on anyone who hears it (no save). Strahd becomes Frenzied and moves toward the Heart Chamber immediately.</li>\n<li><strong>Destabilisation:</strong> Navigation suffers an additional <em>&ndash;10</em>. Random encounters increase to every 15 minutes. Cracks appear in walls, ceilings sag, dust fills the air.</li>\n<li><strong>Warp-Touched Stun:</strong> All warp-touched creatures in the Spire: <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Willpower</em> or Stunned for <em>1d5 rounds</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Strahd loses Regeneration permanently.</strong> Loses all Heart-derived benefits. Drops to Phase 2 regardless of Wounds.</li>\n<li><strong>The Castle Bleeds</strong> (automatic).</li>\n<li><strong>Warp backlash (in chamber):</strong> Everyone present: <em>Very Hard (&ndash;30) WP</em> or gain <em>1d10 Corruption Points</em> and <em>1d10 Insanity Points</em>. Chamber becomes unstable &mdash; 15% chance per round of wall collapse (<em>2d10+5 E</em> from warp exposure). Approximately 10 rounds before the chamber is unsurvivable.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The Crypts</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The stairs descend far longer than they should &mdash; far longer than the mountain's geology would permit. The temperature drops with every step. Your lamp-packs push against a darkness that seems to have physical weight. At the bottom, the passage opens into a low, vaulted corridor lined with hundreds of niches, each containing remains. Some skeletal. Some mummified. Some appearing freshly dead. None of them are truly at rest.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Ambient Effects</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>All light sources: effective range <strong>halved</strong>.</li>\n<li>All Willpower tests to resist Fear: <strong>&ndash;10 penalty</strong>.</li>\n<li>Psykers experience constant psychic static &mdash; <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Psyniscience</em> identifies it as centuries of compressed death and suffering.</li>\n<li>Temperature: &ndash;5&deg;C.

Strahd uses this network to move through the castle with impossible speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Activation:</strong> <em>Hard (&ndash;20) Forbidden Lore (Warp)</em> or <em>Tech-Use</em>. Success: step into the fire, emerge from any other brazier. Failure: emerge from a random brazier (possibly separated from party). Each use, regardless of outcome: <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Willpower</em> or gain <em>1d5 Corruption Points</em> (the process routes the user through the warp).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>#</th><th>Brazier Location</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>1</td><td>Crypt Entrance</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2</td><td>Strahd's Study (Upper Levels)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3</td><td>Heart Chamber</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4</td><td>Courtyard</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5</td><td>North Tower (Observatory)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6</td><td>Chapel (Ground Level)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7</td><td>Strahd's Coffin Chamber (Deepest Crypt)</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Strahd's Coffin &mdash; Permanent Destruction</h3>\n<p>The coffin is a masterwork of dark wood and adamantium banding, lined with crimson silk, engraved with hexagrammic wards of preservation. It radiates a faint psychic pulse. When Strahd is reduced to Critical Damage, he retreats here and regenerates fully in <em>1d10 hours</em> (1d5 if Heart intact).</p>\n<p><strong>Destroying the coffin:</strong> Inflict 30 points of damage (<em>Armour 8</em>, immune to warp/psychic damage) or hold the Rosette of Saint Markovia against it for three consecutive rounds (<em>Challenging (+0) WP</em> each round; coffin deals <em>1d10+3 E, Pen 4</em> to bearer each round).</p>\n<p><strong>Sanctifying the coffin:</strong> Perform a full consecration ritual over three rounds while the coffin is exposed to the Emperor's light via Rosette or Dawn's Edge. Requires <em>Rite of Sanctification</em> or <em>Very Hard (&ndash;30) Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed)</em>. Does not destroy the coffin but renders it useless &mdash; Strahd can no longer regenerate within it.</p>\n<h3>The Three Conditions for Permanent Destruction</h3>\n<p>Lord-Governor Strahd von Zarovich can only be permanently destroyed if <strong>all three conditions</strong> are met simultaneously:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The Heart of the Spire must be destroyed</strong> &mdash; removing his regeneration and severing his connection to the pact's power source.</li>\n<li><strong>His coffin must be destroyed or sanctified</strong> &mdash; eliminating his ability to retreat and reform.</li>\n<li><strong>He must be struck down by Dawn's Edge while the Rosette of Saint Markovia is active</strong> &mdash; the killing blow must come from a weapon of faith, sanctified by the Emperor's light.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If any single condition is unmet, Strahd regenerates within <em>1d10 days</em>. The Tome of Strahd contains this information; without it, the Acolytes risk destroying his body only to have him return. The Tome transforms the final battle from a slugfest into a strategic operation.</p>"
