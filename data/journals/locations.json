Perhaps two hundred souls cling to existence here in hab-blocks of local grey stone, huddled together as if for warmth that never comes. The buildings lean against one another like drunks, their rockcrete foundations cracked, their windows shuttered and dark. The streets are unpaved mud, rutted by cart tracks and pooled with standing water that reflects a sky the colour of a bruise. Nothing moves. Nothing speaks. But you are watched — you feel it in the prickling of your skin, in the way the shutters on every window are cracked just enough for a pair of eyes. The village is not empty. It is <em>terrified.</em></p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Facts</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Property</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Act</td><td>Act I — Descent into the Rift</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Map Reference</td><td>Map 1 (40x30 settlement map)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Population / Status</td><td>~200 souls, feudal agri-settlement, terrified and dying under centuries of Strahd's rule</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Primary Threat</td><td>Psychological — crushed populace, nightly warp-creature assaults on the Burgomaster's manor, Doru the warp-thrall beneath the chapel</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Quest Hooks</td><td>Burgomaster's funeral, escort Ireena to Fortress Vallak, investigate the chapel basement (Doru), meet the Vostra scouts, receive Strahd's letter</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>The First Settlement</h2>\n<p>The Village of Barovus is the Acolytes' first encounter with civilisation on the surface of this cursed world. After the harrowing crash of the Vessel of Lament and the disorienting march through warp-fog, the village emerges from the grey like a half-remembered nightmare of Imperial order gone to rot. It is a place where the Aquila still stands above the chapel door, but its wings are tarnished and its meaning has been hollowed out by three centuries of isolation and despair.</p>\n<p>The village serves a critical narrative function: it grounds the Acolytes in the reality of Barovus. The Vessel of Lament was a contained horror — a dungeon with walls. The village is an open wound, a community of real people who have lived under Strahd's dominion for generations and been broken by it. Every interaction here should reinforce the campaign's central themes: the erosion of faith, the corruption of authority, and the terrible cost of isolation from the Emperor's light. The villagers are not enemies — they are victims, and the Acolytes' response to their suffering will define the moral tone of the entire campaign.</p>\n<p>Mechanically, the village is a resupply point (limited), a social hub, and the launching point for the escort mission to Fortress Vallak that drives Act II. The Acolytes should leave Barovus with Ireena in tow, the weight of Strahd's letter in their pockets, and the grim understanding that the Lord-Governor knows exactly where they are and what they intend to do about it.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Village Layout</h2>\n<p>The village is arranged around a central muddy square with four key structures and roughly twenty hab-blocks of grey stone housing the terrified populace. Roads lead north toward the Zarovich Spire and west toward Fortress Vallak. Ancient vox-casters mounted on poles throughout the village crackle to life at irregular intervals, broadcasting proclamations from Strahd. Half-functional propaganda servitors patrol the streets in pairs, their vox-grilles broadcasting loyalty oaths and their ocular sensors recording everything.</p>\n\n<h3>The Burgomaster's Manor</h3>\n<p><strong>The Burgomaster's Manor</strong> is a two-storey stone structure that was once the finest building in the village. Its windows are boarded. Its doors are barricaded from the inside. Claw marks — deep, deliberate, and far too large to be human — score the exterior walls. The front garden is dead, and the iron fence that surrounds the property is bent inward in several places, as though something tried very hard to get in.</p>\n<p>Inside, the manor is dim and claustrophobic, every window blocked, every entrance reinforced with furniture and scrap metal. The Burgomaster's body lies in an upper room, and <strong>Ireena Kolyana</strong> will not open the door unless <strong>Ismark</strong> vouches for the Acolytes. The barricades show weeks of desperate, improvised reinforcement — testament to the nightly assaults by Strahd's creatures that ultimately killed Kolyan Indirovich through sheer accumulated terror.</p>\n\n<h3>The Chapel of the God-Emperor</h3>\n<p><strong>The Chapel</strong> is the only building the villagers maintain, though \"maintain\" is generous — the roof leaks, the pews are cracked, and the devotional murals have faded to ghosts. It is structurally sound and spiritually significant. A faint aura of sanctity clings to it, the last ember of faith in a world drowning in despair.</p>\n<p><strong>Father Donavich</strong> tends the chapel. He is a broken man — robes filthy, eyes red-rimmed and unfocused, hands trembling. Beneath the chapel floor, accessible by a trap door behind the altar, is the basement where his son <strong>Doru</strong> is chained. The sounds of scratching and a distorted voice moaning <em>\"Father...\"</em> can be heard during quiet moments, particularly during the funeral rites. The basement is a small root cellar reeking of warp corruption and human waste — and in the far corner, illuminated by a single sputtering candle, crouches what remains of a boy who wanted to be a hero.</p>\n\n<h3>The Blood of the Vein</h3>\n<p><strong>The Blood of the Vein</strong> is the village tavern. Its interior is dim, its ale is thin, and its proprietor — <strong>Arik</strong> — serves drinks with the mechanical emptiness of a servitor. He responds to direct questions with monosyllables and stares at nothing. Three <strong>Vostra</strong> travellers sit in the corner: <strong>Ratka</strong>, <strong>Sorva</strong>, and <strong>Emilian</strong> — scouts from Madam Eva's camp, colourfully dressed, adorned with charms and fetishes, and utterly unconcerned by the gloom. They will offer cryptic warnings and directions to the Vostra camp if approached.</p>\n\n<h3>Bildrath's General Store</h3>\n<p><strong>Bildrath's Provisions</strong> is run by <strong>Bildrath</strong>, a bitter, suspicious man who sells basic supplies at extortionate prices (300% markup). His stock is pathetic — a few candles, some rope, dried rations of uncertain provenance, and a single battered lasgun power pack. He has a massive, silent bodyguard named <strong>Parriwimple</strong> (Ogryn ancestry, clearly) who stands behind the counter and stares.</p>\n\n<h3>Village Square</h3>\n<p>The central square is little more than a patch of churned mud where the roads converge. The vox-casters are loudest here, and the propaganda servitors make regular circuits. This is where the funeral procession passes and where Strahd's servitor delivers his letter of welcome. At night, the square is deserted — every villager bolts their doors before dark, and nothing the Acolytes say will convince them otherwise.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key NPCs</h2>\n\n<h3>Ismark Kolyanovich</h3>\n<p><strong>Ismark</strong> finds the Acolytes shortly after their arrival. He is a tall, broad-shouldered man in his early thirties, wearing the battered remnants of an Imperial Guard uniform (Barovian 12th Infantry — a regiment that existed three centuries ago). He carries a chainsword — old, well-maintained, clearly cherished — and moves with a soldier's discipline. His eyes are haunted.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Honest, brave, and deeply frightened. Desperate for help but not pathetic — he carries himself with the bearing of a soldier who knows the odds and fights anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Protect his sister Ireena. Get her to Fortress Vallak, where walls and a garrison might slow Strahd's pursuit. He cannot do this alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Dialogue:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>\"You are offworlders. I can see it — the way you walk, the way you <em>look</em> at things, like you expect the world to make sense. It doesn't. Not here. Not for a long time.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"My father was the Burgomaster. He is dead. Strahd's creatures killed him — not with claws, but with fear. Weeks of it. They came every night, howling and scratching, and my father stood at the door with his pistol and his prayers, and each night he aged a year.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Social Tests:</strong> Responds well to honest, direct communication. <em>Charm (Ordinary +10)</em> or <em>Command (Routine +20)</em> earns his trust and full cooperation. <em>Intimidation</em> makes him defensive but compliant — he is too desperate to refuse help.</p>\n\n<h3>Ireena Kolyana</h3>\n<p><strong>Ireena</strong> is inside the Burgomaster's manor, behind the barricades. She is mid-twenties, dark hair, pale angular face, striking violet eyes that shift and shimmer. She wears a worn bodyglove under a heavy coat and carries a laspistol with recent-use familiarity. Two circular, puckered wounds mar the skin of her throat — Strahd's bite marks, radiating faint psychic energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Frightened but fierce. She will not suffer pity or condescension.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Bury her father with proper rites before leaving. She refuses to depart until the funeral is complete.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Dialogue:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>\"If you have come to gawk at the Lord-Governor's prey, you may leave. If you have come to help, then help. My father needs to be buried before nightfall.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Secret:</strong> She is an emerging psyker — untrained, unregistered — experiencing objects moving when emotional, candle flames bending toward her, whispers others do not hear. A <em>Psyniscience Test (Challenging +0)</em> reveals her latent ability. She has told no one.</p>\n\n<h3>Father Donavich</h3>\n<p><strong>Father Donavich</strong> performs the Burgomaster's funeral rites in a hollow monotone. He is a broken man — filthy robes, red-rimmed unfocused eyes, trembling hands. His faith is shattered by the horror chained beneath his own chapel.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> He prays constantly over his mutated son Doru, hoping for a cure that will never come. He will resist any attempt to enter the basement but can be convinced with compassion.</p>\n\n<h3>Doru</h3>\n<p><strong>Doru</strong> is Donavich's son, chained in the chapel basement. He led a doomed assault on the Zarovich Spire months ago. Strahd slaughtered the attackers and sent Doru back <em>changed</em> — a warp-touched mutant with limbs too long, joints bending wrong, skin the colour of a bruise. His eyes remain human and aware and begging.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Dialogue:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Kill me. Please. Emperor. Kill me.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Combat Profile:</strong> Use Mutant profile (DH core), <em>Fear Rating 1</em>, plus <em>Regeneration (1)</em>, <em>Unnatural Strength x2</em>, and a psychic despair aura (all within 10m must pass <em>Willpower, Challenging +0</em>, or suffer -10 to all tests for 1d5 rounds). Killing him is an act of mercy.</p>\n\n<h3>Minor NPCs</h3>\n<p><strong>Arik</strong> (barkeep) — hollow-eyed, monosyllabic, severe long-term psychological trauma. Functional but barely present.</p>\n<p><strong>Bildrath</strong> (merchant) — bitter, suspicious, 300% markup. Accompanied by <strong>Parriwimple</strong>, his Ogryn-ancestry bodyguard.</p>\n<p><strong>Ratka, Sorva, Emilian</strong> (Vostra scouts) — colourful, warp-touched traders in the tavern. Offer cryptic warnings: <em>\"The Lord of the Spire sees all, but he is blind to what the cards reveal.\"</em> They provide directions to the Vostra camp.</p>\n\n<h2>Encounters</h2>\n<p><strong>The Funeral Procession:</strong> Carrying the Burgomaster's body from the manor to the chapel. No villagers will assist — the Acolytes and Ismark must bear the coffin themselves. The procession is sombre and exposed. Strahd may observe from the fog but does not intervene.</p>\n<p><strong>Strahd's Letter:</strong> A lone, elegant servitor in formal livery approaches the most senior-looking Acolyte, extending a silver tray bearing a sealed envelope with an ornate \"S\" pressed into black wax. The letter is civil, warm, and absolutely menacing — Strahd knows their names, their mission, their location, and their connection to Ireena.</p>\n<p><strong>Nightly Assaults (if the Acolytes remain after dark):</strong> Warp-hounds and servitor-soldiers probe the manor's defences. These are not full combat encounters but atmospheric events — howling, scratching, shapes in the fog — designed to demonstrate why Kolyan Indirovich died of fear.</p>"

Establishes that Strahd knows everything about the Acolytes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Quest Connections</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Main Plot — Ireena:</strong> The escort mission to Fortress Vallak is the primary thread driving the Acolytes into Act II. Ireena will not leave until her father is buried.</li>\n<li><strong>Main Plot — Strahd:</strong> His letter and first encounter establish him as omniscient antagonist. His interest in Ireena (calling her \"Tatyana\") hints at the reincarnation cycle central to the story.</li>\n<li><strong>Relics — Blessed Ammunition:</strong> Father Donavich can perform blessings on bolt ammunition if restored to sanity — requires resolving Doru's situation with compassion.</li>\n<li><strong>Side Quest — Vostra Camp:</strong> The three Vostra scouts in the tavern direct Acolytes to Madam Eva for the Emperor's Tarot reading (Chapter 4).</li>\n<li><strong>Side Quest — Doru:</strong> Killing or freeing Doru is an act of mercy that affects Donavich's willingness to assist and his ability to bless ammunition.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Strahd's Presence</h2>\n<p>Strahd is omnipresent but rarely seen in the village. His influence manifests through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vox-caster broadcasts:</strong> Smooth, cultured voice delivering proclamations, tithe reminders, curfew warnings, and personal messages designed to torment specific villagers.</li>\n<li><strong>Propaganda servitors:</strong> Shambling pairs broadcasting loyalty oaths and recording everything with ocular sensors. Not combat-capable but serve as Strahd's eyes and ears.</li>\n<li><strong>The letter:</strong> Delivered at a dramatically appropriate moment. Demonstrates total awareness of the Acolytes' identities, mission, and connection to Ireena.</li>\n<li><strong>First direct encounter:</strong> Triggered at the GM's discretion (on the road, during the funeral, leaving the Vostra camp, or during the first night). This is a narrative encounter — Strahd cannot be defeated. Any attack is effortlessly deflected. He demonstrates absolute power, expresses delighted interest, and departs on his own terms.</li>\n<li><strong>Nightly probing:</strong> If Acolytes stay in the village, warp-creatures test the manor's defences after dark — atmospheric, not mechanical combat.</li>\n</ul>"

                    "content": "<h2>Encounter Guide</h2>\n<p>The Village of Barovus is the Acolytes' first settlement after the crash of the Vessel of Lament. It is a place of quiet desperation — ~200 souls ground into learned helplessness by centuries of Strahd's rule. Every interaction should reinforce isolation and urgency. The Acolytes should leave wanting to escape this place as badly as its inhabitants do.</p>\n\n<h3>The Approach Road</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> This is <strong>Lost Expedition Site 1: The Pilgrim's Bones</strong> — the first expedition to Barovus, approximately 280 years ago. A Ministorum missionary party. A skeleton in Ministorum robes has been crucified against a road marker — ancient, centuries old. On the corpse: a sanctified rosary (grants +5 to one WP test vs warp entities, then crumbles to dust) and a sealed parchment containing a prayer that trails off mid-word.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Sealed Parchment:</em> \"Most Holy God-Emperor, Sovereign of Mankind, Light Eternal upon the Throne of Terra — I commend my soul unto Your keeping. We came to this world bearing Your word and Your mercy. We found neither welcome nor salvation. The fog has a voice. It speaks our names. Brother Castiel is gone — taken in the night, his screams swallowed by the grey. I alone remain. I write this prayer as the last act of a faithful servant. I beg You, Lord, deliver me from this — I beg You — I\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 IP (first evidence that others came before and failed).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is emotional setup, not mechanical challenge. Do not rush it. Let the players absorb the implications — someone from the Imperium came here centuries ago, with faith and purpose, and died nailed to a signpost. The rosary is a small gift and a grim omen. Let silence do the work.</p>\n\n<h3>Burgomaster's Manor</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Meeting Ireena and Ismark. Ismark seeks out the Acolytes — in the tavern, on the street, or at the manor itself. He needs convincing to trust them fully: <em>Charm (Ordinary +10)</em> or presenting Inquisitorial credentials (automatic success). <em>Command (Routine +20)</em> also works — he responds to authority and directness. <em>Intimidate</em> makes him defensive but compliant; he is too desperate to refuse. Ireena will not open the manor door unless Ismark vouches for the Acolytes. She is traumatised but resolute — fierce, not fragile.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> The manor exterior bears deep claw marks far too large to be human. Windows are boarded and barricaded from inside. The iron fence is bent inward. Inside: the dead Burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich — heart failure after weeks of nightly siege. A search of the manor reveals Strahd's letter (Handout 2) and the Burgomaster's personal journal documenting weeks of escalating nightly assaults. <em>Awareness or Medicae (Challenging +0)</em> on Ireena's throat marks reveals they radiate faint psychic energy — Strahd is draining life force through warp-touch, not conventional means. A <em>Psyniscience (Challenging +0)</em> test reveals Ireena is an emerging, untrained psyker.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> None unless Strahd's letter is read aloud (1 CP from warp-resonance in the words).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is where the escort quest begins. Push Ismark's desperation — he is brave but cannot protect Ireena alone on the road to Fortress Vallak. Ireena will not leave until her father receives proper funeral rites. The psychic revelation about Ireena should be kept quiet if only one Acolyte detects it — it is a slow-burn plot thread, not an immediate crisis.</p>\n\n<h3>Chapel of the God-Emperor</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense / Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Faith Test, Combat, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> The chapel is desecrated — a faint aura of sanctity remains, but it is guttering. <em>Forbidden Lore (Imperial Creed) (Ordinary +10)</em> or <em>Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) (Challenging +0)</em> identifies the nature of the desecration. Attempting to pray here: <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> — success grants 1d5 temporary IP reduction; failure causes 1d5 IP from psychic backlash as corrupted warp energy rebounds through the weakened sanctity.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Father Donavich guards the basement trapdoor behind the altar. If the Acolytes descend, they find Doru — his son, returned from a failed assault on the Zarovich Spire as a warp-touched mutant. 1 Warp-Thrall (Mutant profile, Dangerous threat; Fear 1, Regeneration 1, Unnatural Strength x2, psychic despair aura — all within 10m must pass <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> or suffer -10 to all tests for 1d5 rounds). <strong>Scaling:</strong> Doru is a solo encounter designed for emotional impact. For 6+, add 1 Plague Revenant companion chained nearby.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Donavich's behaviour during the funeral — trembling hands, hollow monotone, filthy robes. <em>Perception or Awareness (Ordinary +10)</em> during the funeral reveals rhythmic scraping from beneath the chapel floor and a distorted voice moaning \"Father...\" repeatedly. Doru still remembers his father's name. He begs for death. He was once a would-be hero.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1d5 IP and 1 CP for descending to the basement and witnessing Doru's state. 1 additional CP if Doru is destroyed in front of Donavich.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is a tragedy, not a dungeon. Donavich is broken beyond repair. Doru is pitiable, not evil — killing him is mercy. If the Acolytes handle the situation with compassion, Donavich is ultimately grateful. Play the human cost. Doru's eyes are still human and aware. That is the worst part.</p>\n\n<h3>Blood of the Vein Tavern</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Investigation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> The tavern is dim, the ale is thin, and proprietor Arik is a hollow-eyed man functioning on autopilot (<em>Medicae or Awareness (Ordinary +10)</em> confirms severe long-term psychological trauma). Three Vostra scouts — Ratka, Sorva, and Emilian — drink in the corner. They are colourfully dressed, adorned with charms, and utterly unconcerned by the village's gloom. <em>Charm (Challenging +0)</em> or buying drinks (<em>Charm</em> gains +20 bonus) loosens their tongues. They offer cryptic warnings about Strahd, directions to the Vostra camp, and rumours about Madam Eva's Tarot readings.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Overhear rumours about Fortress Vallak, the \"mad Burgomaster\" Vallakovich, and the Vostra camp. Local rotgut available (recaf substitute; -5 to BS for 1d5 hours but +5 to social tests). Behind the bar: scratched tally marks — over 112,000 of them. A <em>Logic (Routine +20)</em> test or simple arithmetic reveals this is approximately 307 years of daily marks.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is an information hub. Seed 2-3 hooks for Act 2 locations through the Vostra scouts and overheard rumours. The tally marks are a gut-punch if anyone does the maths — let the players work it out themselves. Do not explain it for them.</p>\n\n<h3>Bildrath's Store</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Bildrath is bitter and suspicious. He charges 10x standard prices (300% markup on everything). <em>Commerce (Hard -20)</em> or <em>Intimidate (Challenging +0)</em> to negotiate prices down. Warning: <em>Intimidate</em> provokes Parriwimple, his nephew — an ogryn-sized simpleton who is fiercely protective of his uncle. Parriwimple is not hostile unless provoked but is a serious physical threat if angered.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Limited Imperial-standard supplies — mostly local equivalents. Stock includes candles, rope, dried rations of uncertain provenance, and a single battered lasgun power pack. 1 clip of autopistol ammunition is available at 25x standard price (incredibly rare on Barovus).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Establish the scarcity economy early. This is the worst deal the Acolytes will find in Barovus — but it may be the only option until they reach Fortress Vallak. Do not let them bully Bildrath without consequence; Parriwimple is the consequence.</p>\n\n<h3>Village Square</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Social</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The Burgomaster's funeral procession crosses the square — rain, warp-fog creeping at the edges, villagers watching from behind shuttered windows but refusing to participate. At night: howling from the woods. If Ireena remains in the manor, nightly assaults occur — warp-hounds, servitor-soldiers, and worse scratch at walls and howl outside. Propaganda servitors patrol the streets in pairs, broadcasting loyalty oaths and recording everything through ocular sensors. Ancient vox-casters crackle to life at irregular intervals with Strahd's proclamations.</p>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> At the GM's chosen moment (ideally after the funeral), an elegant servitor in formal livery approaches the most senior-looking Acolyte and delivers Strahd's letter on a silver tray. The letter is civil, warm, and laced with pure menace — Strahd knows their names, mission, location, and connection to Ireena. Public reading of the letter causes 1 CP to all listeners from warp-resonance.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Nightly attack patterns — assaults focus on the manor while Ireena is present. Once she leaves, the village gets one night of peace, then attacks resume anyway. This is Strahd's cruelty made manifest: the suffering was never about Ireena alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP from Strahd's letter (if read or heard). 1 IP from witnessing the nightly assault (screaming, scratching at walls, inhuman howling).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Build urgency to leave. Every night the Acolytes stay risks another assault. The letter should feel like a violation — Strahd knows everything, has always known, and wants them to know that he knows. The postscript about Ireena is the knife twist.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Boarding Deck</h2>\n<p>The airlock opens into a cavernous, vaulted boarding deck — too large for a transport vessel of this class, reshaped by warp influence. The ship's name <em>DURST'S LAMENT</em> is stencilled on the far bulkhead. Devotional aquilas line the walls, cracked and subtly wrong. Gargoyle-headed vox-casters crouch at junction points. The ghost-children <strong>Rose</strong> and <strong>Thorn Durst</strong> appear here, begging for help against \"the monster in the lower decks.\" If Acolytes attempt retreat, the airlock seals and corridors rearrange — the ship is the only option.</p>\n\n<h2>Upper Deck (7 Rooms)</h2>\n\n<h3>UD1 — Main Corridor [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>A grand central corridor with chequered dark iron and tarnished brass deck plates. Trophy cases display six-legged Barovian predators in cracked stasis jars. <strong>Portraits</strong> line both walls — formal Durst family pict-captures that <em>change</em> when not directly observed (faces rot, smiles widen to rictus grins). <em>Willpower (Ordinary +10)</em> on first noticing; failure: 1 <em>Insanity Point</em>. Slaaneshi corruption detectable with <em>Forbidden Lore (Chaos), Challenging +0</em>.</p>\n\n<h3>UD2 — Officer's Mess [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>A long table set for a meal that appears freshly prepared — but watching it causes the food to rot in real time. Consuming any food: <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> or 1d5 Wounds (ignoring armour) and nausea for 1d10 rounds.</p>\n\n<h3>UD3 — The Captain's Quarters [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>The most important upper deck room. Data-slate racks and bookshelves fill every wall. <em>Search (Ordinary +10)</em> reveals <strong>Captain Gustav Durst's journal</strong> behind a false bulkhead — documenting the crew's 15-year descent into Slaaneshi heresy, the rituals, and the children's deaths (\"We forgot them\"). Reading in full: <strong>1d5 Insanity Points, 1 Corruption Point</strong>, but grants +20 to subsequent <em>Forbidden Lore (Chaos)</em> tests on the vessel. Also contains the wedding date <strong>14.08.37</strong> — the armory cipher code.</p>\n\n<h3>UD4 — Crew Mess and Galley [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>Largely unremarkable. <em>Search (Challenging +0)</em> yields expired ration packs and an ancient laspistol with 1 shot. Adjoining crew quarters show signs of hasty abandonment — bloodstains forming near-Chaos sigils.</p>\n\n<h3>UD5 — Bridge / Command Deck [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Sealed blast door (manual release). Three points of interest: <strong>Navigation Cogitators</strong> (<em>Tech-Use, Challenging +0</em> — success grants +10 to <em>Navigate (Surface)</em> on Barovus for the campaign; failure by 3+ degrees: corrupted data-burst, 1 IP). <strong>Navigator's Corpse</strong> (death-grip reflex on touch — opposed <em>Strength</em> to break free; failure: 1d5 IP, 1 CP, but insight that the anomaly has an edge). <strong>Captain's final log</strong> (audio recording of the crash toward Barovus — narrative only).</p>\n\n<h3>UD6 — Armory / Ship's Locker [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Cipher-locked (code 14.08.37 from journal, or <em>Common Lore/Scholastic Lore (Imperial Navy), Ordinary +10</em>, or <em>Security, Hard -20</em> brute force). <strong>Booby trap</strong> if forced: concealed shotgun mechanism (1d10+4 I, Pen 0, Scatter). Detect: <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em>; Disarm: <em>Security (Ordinary +10)</em>. Contents: Best-Quality autopistol (18 rounds), Best-Quality balanced boarding cutlass, 2 frag grenades.</p>\n\n<h3>UD7 — Astropath's Chamber [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>A sanctified pocket — corruption stops at the threshold. Clean air, warm like remembered sunlight. The Astropath's skeleton sits in peaceful meditation. <strong>Sanctuary Effect:</strong> 10 minutes rest removes 1 <em>Insanity Point</em> (once per Acolyte). <strong>Psychic Echo</strong> (<em>Psyniscience, Challenging +0</em>): fragmentary message — <em>\"the children are the key... the entity fears what it consumed... the altar is the chain\"</em> — speaking the children's names during the boss fight grants +10 to <em>Willpower Tests</em>. <strong>Sending-Stone:</strong> grants +20 to attacks against the altar-engine; disrupts Phase 2 effects; crumbles after use.</p>\n\n<h2>Mid Deck (8 Rooms)</h2>\n\n<h3>MD1 — Captain's Private Chambers [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>Oppressively lavish — silks, perfumes, mirrors covering every surface. Mirrors show the compartment in its prime, populated by beautiful figures who are <em>watching the Acolytes</em>. <em>Awareness (Ordinary +10)</em> to notice; <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> or 1 IP. Locked jewellery box (<em>Security, Ordinary +10</em>): cameo locket of Elisabeth Durst, precious stones (~200 Thrones).</p>\n\n<h3>MD2 — The Children's Cabin [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>Two small beds, children's drawings, toy box. Freezing cold — breath mists. If Acolytes linger, Rose and Thorn manifest on their beds. Rose recounts their death: sealed in by parents who never returned. <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> or <strong>1d5 Insanity Points</strong>. The children beg the Acolytes to destroy the monster below \"so we can sleep.\"</p>\n\n<h3>MD3 — Hidden Shrine [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Concealed hatch (<em>Search, Difficult -10</em>, or <em>Awareness, Hard -20</em>). Eight-pointed star inlaid in the deck, black tallow candles, blood-and-obscura offerings. <strong>1 Corruption Point</strong> on entry (automatic), +1 CP per 10 additional minutes. Palpable Slaaneshi aura (auto-detect with <em>Psyniscience</em>).</p>\n\n<h3>MD4 — Sealed Storage Bay [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>Contains <strong>Elisabeth Durst's</strong> preserved corpse and her sealed letter confessing to the family's damnation, the entity fused to the warp drive, and the children's fate. The letter inflicts <strong>1 Insanity Point</strong> and provides critical context. <em>Logic or Scholastic Lore (Occult), Ordinary +10</em> to piece together the full picture.</p>\n\n<h3>MD5 — Medicae Bay [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Warp-echo of Elisabeth Durst performing ritual vivisection plays automatically: <strong>1 Insanity Point</strong> (no save). <em>Search (Ordinary +10)</em>: 2 doses of de-tox, 1 stimm. <strong>Mimic-Cabinet Trap:</strong> fleshy tendrils grapple (Strength 40, 1d10+2 R/round, 12 Wounds, vulnerable to fire). Detect: <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em>.</p>\n\n<h3>MD6 — Crew Quarters (Main) [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p><strong>Vasily Hent's journal</strong> in a foot-locker: grants +10 to <em>Fellowship Tests</em> with ghost-children, and reveals power conduit sequence (red-blue-green) for MD7. <strong>Sleeping Gas Trap:</strong> pressure plate releases soporific gas; <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> or 2 levels of Fatigue. Detect: <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em>; disarm: <em>Security (Ordinary +10)</em>.</p>\n\n<h3>MD7 — Enginarium Access Corridor [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Alternative route to lower decks. Complete darkness. <strong>Power Routing Puzzle:</strong> red-blue-green sequence restores lower deck lumens (removes darkness penalties, boss loses concealment attacks). Wrong sequence (1st): 1d10 E damage to all in corridor. Wrong (2nd): permanent failure, mid deck lighting becomes intermittent.</p>\n\n<h3>MD8 — Cargo Hold [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Slaaneshi tribute cache: silk, perfume, jewellery, ~200 Thrones. Taking items: <strong>1 Corruption Point/day</strong> while carried; <em>Willpower (Ordinary +10)</em> daily to voluntarily discard. <strong>Sanctified Incense Censer</strong> (hidden in corner): 3 charges, each creates 5m radius sanctified zone for 10 minutes (+10 to <em>Willpower Tests</em> vs. warp phenomena, fear, psychic attacks). Significant find.</p>\n\n<h2>Lower Deck — Engineering (7 Rooms)</h2>\n<p><strong>Descent:</strong> Hidden behind data-slate rack in captain's quarters (<em>Search, Challenging +0</em>). Service ladder into absolute darkness. The vessel transitions from machine to living organism — bulkheads glisten with flesh-warmth, ladder rungs are slick with copper-and-perfume moisture. <strong>All Acolytes gain 1 Corruption Point</strong> upon entering the lower decks.</p>\n\n<h3>LD1 — The Brig [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>Corridor lined with brig cells. Two cells still hold skeletal remains showing ritual mutilation (<em>Medicae, Ordinary +10</em> to identify Slaaneshi practices). <strong>1 Insanity Point</strong> for close examination.</p>\n\n<h3>LD2 — Engineering Antechamber [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>Metal benches, a lectern with a Chaos liturgy book. Reading the book: <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> to put it down; reading more than a few pages: <strong>1d10 Insanity Points, 1d5 Corruption Points</strong>. With <em>Forbidden Lore (Chaos)</em>: safe skim (1 CP only), learn the cult summoned a daemon bound to the warp drive.</p>\n\n<h3>LD3 — The Warp Drive Chamber [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<p>The boss arena. Cathedral-vaulted engineering bay with bone-and-metal mosaic forming an eight-pointed star. The corrupted altar-engine — fused bone, black iron, engine components — pulses at the centre. See <strong>Boss Fight</strong> page for full encounter details.</p>\n\n<h3>LD4 — Congregation Hall [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Warp-expanded cathedral space (4x the volume the ship's schematics allow). Bone-and-metal pews, murals depicting the Durst family's fall in five panels. 1d5+2 warp-echo worshippers (non-hostile, can be dispersed by prayer or sanctified items). Studying murals: <strong>1 Corruption Point</strong>. Peaceful dispersal of all echoes: each Acolyte regains 1 Fatigue.</p>\n\n<h3>LD5 — Sacrificial Preparation Chamber [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Charnel house — blood-layered bulkheads, restraint slab, instrument rack, clogged drain. Enter: <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or <strong>1d5 Insanity Points</strong>. <strong>Ritual Knife:</strong> Best-Quality knife (+5 damage), but 1 CP/day carried and <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> to put down; glows near warp entities. <strong>Victim's Escape Map:</strong> scratched under slab — automatic Navigate success in lower decks, marks LD6. <strong>Pit Trap:</strong> drainage grate collapses; <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> to detect; 1d10 I damage, <em>Agility (Challenging +0)</em> to climb out.</p>\n\n<h3>LD6 — Engine Crawlspace [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Flanking route to LD3. Narrow, dark, hot (1d5 E per 10 minutes without protection). Navigation: victim's map = auto-success, or <em>Navigate (Surface), Challenging +0</em>. All combat at -20 WS/BS, no two-handed weapons. <strong>Tactical Reward:</strong> emerging behind the altar-engine grants a surprise round with +20 to hit on the first round.</p>\n\n<h3>LD7 — Heart of the Vessel (Hidden Chamber) [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<p>Concealed behind a bulkhead panel visible only after the altar-engine is destroyed/damaged. Clean, cold, intact — preserved by residual Gellar field. <strong>Gellar Field Modulator:</strong> single-use, creates 10m warp-ward for 8 hours (+20 to <em>Corruption Tests</em>, warp-touched at -10 to all Characteristics). Extraordinarily valuable for Barovus. <strong>Stasis Pod:</strong> contains <strong>Vasily Hent</strong> (Enginseer's Mate), alive after 200 years. <em>Tech-Use (Ordinary +10)</em> to revive. Potential NPC ally or replacement character. Gains 2d10 IP on revival; <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or breakdown for 1d10 rounds.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key NPCs</h2>\n\n<h3>Rose and Thorn Durst (Ghost-Children)</h3>\n<p><strong>Rose</strong> (approximately ten years old) and <strong>Thorn</strong> (approximately six) are warp-echoes — psychic imprints of children who died on this vessel over two centuries ago, locked in their cabin by parents who \"forgot\" them. They appear as living, breathing children, not obviously spectral.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Terrified, desperate, pitiable. They are not malicious but are compelled by the ship's lure to draw victims deeper inside.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection:</strong> <em>Awareness (Hard -20)</em>: they cast no shadows, their breath produces no mist, their feet do not quite touch the deck plates. <em>Psyniscience (Challenging +0)</em>: warp-echoes, not true spirits.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Dialogue:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Please. There is a monster in our ship. In the lower decks. Our parents won't wake up. Please help us.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"We died here. Mother and Father sealed the hatch. They said it was to keep us safe from the monster. But they never came back. We waited. We were so hungry. Thorn cried. Then Thorn stopped crying. Then I stopped too.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mechanical Role:</strong> Speaking their names during the boss fight and calling on them to resist the entity grants all allies <strong>+10 to Willpower Tests</strong> for the remainder of the encounter. This clue is obtained from the Astropath's psychic echo (UD7). Vasily Hent's journal (MD6) also provides +10 to <em>Fellowship Tests</em> with the children.</p>\n\n<h3>Vasily Hent (Stasis Survivor)</h3>\n<p><strong>Vasily</strong> is the ship's Enginseer's Mate, preserved in a stasis pod in the hidden chamber (LD7) for approximately 200 years. He sealed himself in when the cult's activities became undeniable.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Confused, terrified, but grateful. Deeply traumatised (gains 2d10 IP on revival). Requires time and kindness to become functional.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Tech-Use (basic), Trade (Armourer) — useful for equipment maintenance on Barovus.</p>\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> Potential NPC ally for the campaign or replacement character hook if an Acolyte died during the dungeon. Source of historical information about the vessel and the cult's early formation.</p>\n\n<h2>Enemy Encounters</h2>\n\n<h3>Warp-Echo Cultists (Phase 2 Boss Fight)</h3>\n<p>1d5 translucent, flickering spectral figures that manifest from the bulkheads during Phase 2. Use Cultist profiles with half Wounds and the <em>Incorporeal</em> trait (immune to mundane weapons; force weapons, sanctified weapons, and psychic attacks deal normal damage). They dissolve permanently when destroyed.</p>\n\n<h3>Warp-Echo Worshippers (LD4 — Congregation Hall)</h3>\n<p>1d5+2 translucent specters frozen in rapturous worship. Non-hostile. Can be dispersed by prayer (1d5 per prayer), sanctified items (incense censer disperses all instantly), or violence (any attack disrupts one, but this feels profoundly wrong). Peaceful dispersal grants Fatigue recovery.</p>\n\n<h3>Environmental \"Enemies\"</h3>\n<p>The ship itself is the primary antagonist beyond the boss. Bulkheads seal behind the Acolytes. Corridors rearrange. The organic walls contract. Power conduits rupture. The mimic-cabinet in MD5. The sleeping gas trap in MD6. The pit trap in LD5. The ship's malign intelligence works to separate, disorient, and terrorise.</p>\n\n<h2>Social Encounters</h2>\n<p>There are no traditional social encounters aboard the Vessel of Lament — the ship is a dead place populated by echoes and a daemon. However, the ghost-children function as a pseudo-social encounter: they respond to kindness, can be comforted (though not saved until the entity is destroyed), and provide crucial information through their dialogue. The Acolytes' treatment of Rose and Thorn is an early moral test that sets the tone for the campaign's approach to compassion in horror.</p>"

Their spectral presence echoes Ireena's vulnerability and the cycle of suffering Strahd perpetuates.</li>\n<li><strong>Relics — Sending-Stone:</strong> A key tactical resource for the boss fight. The Astropath's psychic echo also provides the clue about invoking the children's names.</li>\n<li><strong>Campaign Resource — Gellar Field Modulator:</strong> The single-use warp-ward from LD7 is one of the most valuable items in the entire campaign for surviving on Barovus.</li>\n<li><strong>Campaign Resource — Navigation Data:</strong> The +10 Navigate bonus from the bridge cogitators persists for the entire campaign.</li>\n<li><strong>NPC — Vasily Hent:</strong> Potential long-term ally or replacement character.

However, his influence permeates the experience indirectly: the ship exists because of the warp anomaly that Strahd's pact created. The anomaly pulled the Acolytes' vessel into the system. The ghost-children, the Durst family's fall, and the entity in the warp drive are all consequences of the same Slaaneshi corruption that sustains Strahd's immortality. The GM should draw these connections subtly — Captain Durst's journal references \"the Lord-Governor\" and his \"pact with the powers beyond the veil,\" establishing Strahd's shadow even before the Acolytes set foot on Barovus.</p>"

Over centuries, it has fused with the engine itself, becoming a hybrid of daemon-flesh and machine — neither fully warp entity nor fully mechanism, but something worse than either. When it manifests, it tears itself free of the altar-engine in a spray of bone, ichor, and sparking power conduits.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>The corridor opens into the main engineering bay — a vaulted chamber that should not exist on a vessel of this class — vast, cathedral-like, its ceiling lost in shadow and the tangle of power conduits and coolant pipes that have fused with organic matter. The deck is a mosaic of bone and dark metal, forming a massive eight-pointed star. At its centre, where the warp drive's core housing should be, stands a corrupted altar of fused bone, black iron, and engine components — the drive and the shrine have become one, stained with centuries of dried blood and machine oil turned to ichor. The altar-engine <em>pulses.</em> Something within it is aware of you.</p></blockquote>\n\n<h2>Entity Profile</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Value</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>WS</td><td>45</td></tr>\n<tr><td>BS</td><td>20</td></tr>\n<tr><td>S</td><td>45</td></tr>\n<tr><td>T</td><td>50</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Ag</td><td>40</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Int</td><td>30</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Per</td><td>40</td></tr>\n<tr><td>WP</td><td>55</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Fel</td><td>15</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wounds</td><td>30</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Armour</td><td>4 (All, unnatural flesh)</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Traits:</strong> <em>Daemonic</em> (TB 10 vs. non-blessed/non-force weapons), <em>Fear 2 (Frightening)</em>, <em>From Beyond</em>, <em>Strange Physiology</em>, <em>Warp Instability</em></p>\n<p><strong>Attacks:</strong> Bone-Lash Tendrils (Melee; 1d10+5 R; Pen 2; Flexible, Snare), Psychic Shriek (20m; WP Test or 1d10+3 E ignoring armour, plus 1 IP)</p>\n\n<h2>Phase 1 — The Awakening (100% to 50% Wounds)</h2>\n<p>The creature fights defensively, using tendrils to grapple and separate Acolytes. It shrieks when wounded, dealing psychic damage to all in range. It cannot leave the warp drive chamber. It prioritises isolating the most dangerous combatant and dragging them toward the altar-engine, where contact inflicts <strong>1d5 Corruption Points per round</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ship Turns Hostile:</strong> Once engaged, the vessel itself works against the Acolytes. Bulkhead hatches slam shut. Organic walls constrict corridors. Power conduits rupture. <em>Navigate (Surface) or Logic (Challenging +0)</em> required to find the way back once the fight begins.</p>\n\n<h2>Phase 2 — The Surge (50% to 25% Wounds)</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The creature <em>screams</em> — not in pain but in command. The altar-engine flares with sickly light, and the air itself splits open in a dozen places. Warp-light — raw, unfiltered Immaterium — floods the chamber in strobing pulses of pink and violet. The organic walls contract. The ceiling lowers. The room is shrinking around you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The following effects trigger simultaneously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warp-Light Surge:</strong> All Acolytes: <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> or Stunned 1 round. Psykers at -10 to this test.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultist Echoes:</strong> 1d5 warp-echo cultists manifest — Cultist profiles with half Wounds, <em>Incorporeal</em> trait. Immune to mundane weapons; vulnerable to force, sanctified, and psychic attacks. Dissolve permanently when destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Constricting Chamber:</strong> Organic walls contract for 3 rounds, shrinking ~1m per round. Acolytes at edges: <em>Agility (Ordinary +10)</em> each round or pushed inward and take 1d5 I damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Sending-Stone Disruption:</strong> If carried (from UD7), activate as a Half Action: cultist echoes dissolve, chamber stops constricting, entity takes <strong>2d10 E damage</strong> (ignoring armour). Stone crumbles to dust.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Phase 3 — The Fusion (25% to 0% Wounds)</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The creature no longer resembles anything that was ever alive. It has pulled itself into the altar-engine like a parasite burrowing into a wound, and the engine has responded — power conduits throb with black light, the bone-metal floor cracks and heaves, and the entire chamber vibrates with a frequency that makes your teeth ache and your vision blur. The entity has become the drive. The drive has become the entity. And both are <em>furious.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Escalation:</strong> All Characteristics gain +10. Armour increases to 6 (All). New attacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warp Vortex (Free Action, 1/round):</strong> Micro-rift strikes a random Acolyte: <strong>2d10 E, Pen 5</strong>. Target: <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or gain <strong>1d5 Corruption Points</strong>. The rift point can be attacked (5 Wounds, no armour) or disrupted by prayer (+10 to hit with sanctified weapons).</li>\n<li><strong>Collapsing Floor (start of each round):</strong> Random 2m x 2m section gives way. Acolytes on it: <em>Agility (Challenging +0)</em> or fall for <strong>2d10 E damage</strong>; <em>Strength (Ordinary +10)</em> to climb back up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Shared Health Pool:</strong> In Phase 3, the altar-engine and entity share a single health pool — damage to either affects both. This is the entity's most dangerous but most vulnerable state.</p>\n\n<h2>The Altar-Engine</h2>\n<p>The corrupted warp drive core has <strong>Armour 8</strong> and <strong>20 Wounds</strong>. It can be attacked separately in Phases 1 and 2 (it shares a health pool with the entity only in Phase 3). Prayer while attacking grants <strong>+10 to hit, +2 damage</strong>.

The ship is seized by the warp rift and dragged toward Barovus.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The warp drive core cracks — a sound like a world breaking. Black ichor and superheated plasma erupt from the fissure, and the creature fused with it <em>screams</em> — not with a voice but with the fabric of reality itself. The organic bulkheads shudder, contract, and begin to rot — centuries of decay happening in seconds. And then the ship <em>lurches.</em> The warp anomaly is pulling you through. Toward Barovus. And it is tearing itself apart.</p></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Escape Sequence (5 Rounds)</h3>\n<p>The Acolytes have <strong>5 rounds</strong> to reach a crash station or saviour pod on the upper decks.

The vessel plunges through the rift like a burning spear. The impact is the end of everything you knew. You crawl from the wreckage into grey fog so thick it has <em>texture</em> — it slides across your skin like damp silk, carrying a sweet, cloying scent of flowers rotting on a grave.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Acolytes emerge from the wreckage onto Barovus. <strong>All Acolytes gain 1 Corruption Point</strong> from exposure to the warp-fog (unavoidable).

                    "content": "<h2>Encounter Guide</h2>\n<p>The Vessel of Lament is the campaign's introductory dungeon — a warp-saturated cursed ship that teaches players the core lessons of Barovus: the warp corrupts everything, investigation matters as much as combat, faith has mechanical power, and not everything can be fought. 22 rooms across 3 decks, designed for 1-2 sessions. Rooms are marked [CRITICAL PATH] or [OPTIONAL]. A party in a hurry can reach the boss without visiting every compartment, but optional rooms contain valuable resources, lore, and tactical advantages.</p>\n\n<h3>Boarding Deck — The Children's Lure</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Discovery, Social</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The airlock opens onto a cavernous boarding deck — too large for a vessel of this class. Organic sheen coats every surface. Emergency lumens flicker in sickly amber. The ship's name is stenciled on the far bulkhead: DURST'S LAMENT. Devotional aquilas line the walls, their details subtly <em>wrong</em>. Gargoyle-headed vox-casters crouch at junctions. If Acolytes attempt to retreat, the airlock seals and corridors rearrange — the ship will not release them.</p>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Rose and Thorn Durst — spectral children, age ~10 and ~6 — stand in the centre, appearing as living children. They beg for help: \"Please, there is a monster in our ship. In the lower decks. Our parents won't wake up.\" <em>Awareness (Hard -20)</em> reveals they cast no shadows, produce no breath-mist, and their feet do not touch the deck. <em>Psyniscience (Challenging +0)</em> confirms they are warp-echoes — psychic imprints, not malicious but compelled to lure victims deeper.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP upon boarding (unavoidable, from anomaly exposure during the boarding sequence).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The children are victims, not enemies. They are part of the ship's lure but genuinely want the monster destroyed. Their names — Rose and Thorn — become mechanically important in the boss fight (UD7 clue). Establish early that retreat is impossible.</p>\n\n<h3>UD1-UD2: Main Corridor and Officer's Mess [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The main corridor is too grand for a transport — chequered deck plates of dark iron and tarnished brass, trophy cases with preserved six-legged predators in cracked stasis jars. The air smells of old incense and Slaaneshi musk (<em>Forbidden Lore (Chaos) (Challenging +0)</em> to identify). Portraits line the walls — normal when observed directly, but faces rot and smiles widen into rictus grins when looked away from and back. <em>Willpower (Ordinary +10)</em> required the first time this is noticed; failure: 1 IP.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The Officer's Mess (UD2) has a table set for a formal meal — freshly prepared food that rots before the Acolytes' eyes when watched. Consuming any food: <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> or 1d5 Wounds (ignoring armour) plus violent nausea for 1d10 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 IP (shifting portraits, first occurrence only).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Set the tone — the ship is wrong in ways that accumulate. The portraits are the first sign that reality is unstable here. The rotting food is visceral horror, not a trap — do not punish curiosity too harshly, but make it memorable.</p>\n\n<h3>UD3-UD4: Captain's Quarters and Crew Quarters [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Investigation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> The Captain's Quarters (UD3) contain the most important find on the upper deck. <em>Search (Ordinary +10)</em> reveals Captain Gustav Durst's hidden journal behind a false bulkhead panel. The journal documents the crew's descent into Slaaneshi heresy over 15 years — from desperation to ritual worship to the children's death by neglect. Reading in full: 1d5 IP and 1 CP, but grants +20 to subsequent <em>Forbidden Lore (Chaos)</em> tests within the vessel. The journal also contains the armory cipher code (14.08.37) — discoverable with <em>Logic (Routine +20)</em> while reviewing.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Crew Quarters (UD4) — largely empty. <em>Search (Challenging +0)</em> yields a cache of expired ration packs and a functioning ancient laspistol (common quality, 1 shot only). Bloodstains on deck plates form patterns close to Chaos sigils.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1d5 IP and 1 CP (from reading Durst's journal in full).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The journal is essential narrative scaffolding — it explains the ship's history and makes the lower decks meaningful. Encourage thorough searching. The cipher code payoff comes at the Armory (UD6). The single-shot laspistol is a tease, not a game-changer.</p>\n\n<h3>UD5: Bridge / Command Deck [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Skill Challenge, Discovery, Combat</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> Navigation cogitators — <em>Tech-Use (Challenging +0)</em> extracts fragmentary data: warp-current charts, partial Barovus cartography, pre-rift surface survey. Success grants +10 to <em>Navigate (Surface)</em> tests on Barovus for the remainder of the campaign. Failure by 3+ degrees triggers a corrupted data-burst (montage of the crew's final days): 1 IP.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Navigator's Corpse — not true reanimation but a psychic reflex. If touched or searched, the corpse's hand clamps shut on the Acolyte's wrist. <em>Opposed Strength Test</em> to break free; failure means Grappled for 1d5 rounds while flooded with the Navigator's final psychic impressions. 1d5 IP and 1 CP, but the Acolyte gains critical campaign knowledge: the anomaly has an edge — Barovus is in a pocket <em>within</em> the warp, not the warp itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Captain's final bridge log — a broken audio recording: \"...the drive is gone. Elisabeth's thing has consumed it. We are being pulled toward... Emperor, the planet... it is beautiful and it is wrong. I am sorry, Rose. I am sorry, Thorn. I forgot. I forgot.\" No mechanical effect; reinforces the tragedy.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 IP (cogitator failure). Up to 1d5 IP and 1 CP (Navigator corpse grapple).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The Navigation data is a genuine long-term reward. The Navigator corpse encounter is high-risk/high-reward — the endgame insight is valuable but the IP/CP cost is steep. Let players weigh the risk.</p>\n\n<h3>UD6: Armory / Ship's Locker [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Skill Challenge, Trap</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> Cipher-lock puzzle — six-digit code required. Three approaches: (1) <em>Common Lore (Imperial Navy)</em> or <em>Scholastic Lore (Imperial Navy) (Ordinary +10)</em> — deduce the code from commissioning date protocol. (2) Captain Durst's journal (UD3) contains the code: 14.08.37 (his wedding anniversary). (3) <em>Security (Hard -20)</em> — brute-force bypass, but failure triggers the booby trap.</p>\n<p><strong>Traps:</strong> Concealed shotgun mechanism. <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> to detect before triggering; <em>Security (Ordinary +10)</em> to disarm. If triggered: 1d10+4 I, Pen 0, Scatter against the Acolyte in front of the door. Dodge Test applies.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Armory contents — a Best-Quality autopistol (loaded, 18 rounds), a Best-Quality sword with Balanced quality (boarding cutlass), 2 frag grenades (ancient but functional). Empty lasgun rack — long since looted by the cult.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is a significant loot room gated behind a puzzle. Reward players who read Durst's journal carefully — the code is there. The booby trap punishes brute force but is survivable. These weapons are meaningful upgrades for starting Acolytes.</p>\n\n<h3>UD7: Astropath's Chamber [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Faith Test, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The hatch is stuck, not locked — <em>Strength (Ordinary +10)</em> to force open. Unlike the rest of the ship, this room is genuinely sanctified. The organic corruption stops at the threshold. The air smells of incense and ozone. The Astropath died peacefully of starvation, sealed in by choice, faith intact. The room is still holy ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> Sanctuary Effect — any Acolyte who rests here for 10+ minutes may remove 1 IP (once per Acolyte, one time only). Describe it as profoundly restorative — a moment of genuine peace. This is an extraordinary gift in a campaign that distributes IP aggressively.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Psychic Echo — a psyker who meditates here, or any Acolyte who passes <em>Psyniscience (Challenging +0)</em>, receives a fragmentary message: \"...the children are the key... the children are the lock... do not destroy them, free them... the entity fears what it consumed... the altar is the chain...\" This is a genuine boss-fight clue: speaking the children's names during the LD6 fight and calling on them to resist grants all allies +10 to WP tests for the encounter. Sending-Stone: a psychic amplification stone among the Astropath's effects grants +20 to attacks against the altar-engine in LD6. It can also be activated during Phase 2 to disrupt all Phase 2 effects, deal 2d10 E damage (ignoring armour) to the entity, and dissolve the warp-echo cultists. Crumbles to dust after use.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> None — this room heals, not harms.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the light in the darkness. Do not skip or underplay it. The sanctuary effect, the psychic clue, and the sending-stone are all significant rewards for thorough exploration. The room mechanically reinforces the campaign theme: the Emperor's light persists even here.</p>\n\n<h3>MD1: Captain's Private Chambers [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Oppressively lavish — silks, perfumes (still potent after centuries), mirrors covering every surface. The mirrors do not reflect accurately: they show the compartment populated by beautiful, laughing figures. <em>Awareness (Ordinary +10)</em> reveals the figures are watching the Acolytes. <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> required; failure: 1 IP.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Locked jewellery box (<em>Security (Ordinary +10)</em> or brute force) contains a cameo locket with Elisabeth Durst's portrait and precious stones worth ~200 Thrones. The hidden shrine (MD3) is accessible from here — concealed hatch behind a storage locker (<em>Search (Difficult -10)</em> or <em>Awareness (Hard -20)</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 IP (mirror watchers, on failed WP test).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Slaaneshi excess made tangible. The mirrors are deeply unsettling — the figures are aware and interested. The concealed hatch to MD3 rewards thorough searching but leads to a CP-heavy area.</p>\n\n<h3>MD2: The Children's Cabin [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Two small beds, children's drawings (happy scenes of family and stars), a toy box. The cabin is far colder than the rest of the ship — breath mists here. If the Acolytes linger, Rose and Thorn manifest on their beds. Rose speaks: \"We died here. Mother and Father sealed the hatch. They said it was to keep us safe from the monster. But they never came back. We waited. We were so hungry. Thorn cried. Then Thorn stopped crying. Then I stopped too.\" <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> required; failure: 1d5 IP. The children beg the Acolytes to destroy the monster below — \"so we can sleep.\" If promised, they fade with expressions of fragile hope.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> The children cannot leave the cabin. They are bound to this room where they died. Their names — Rose and Thorn — are mechanically significant in the boss fight (see UD7 clue).</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> Up to 1d5 IP (failed WP test upon hearing Rose's account).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the emotional heart of the dungeon. Play it quietly. Rose is articulate and brave; Thorn is silent and clings to his sister. The revelation that their parents locked them in and forgot should land like a blow. This is where players learn that mercy and horror coexist on Barovus.</p>\n\n<h3>MD3: Hidden Shrine [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Concealed behind a false bulkhead in the Captain's chambers. An eight-pointed star carved into the deck, inlaid with hardened organic material. Black tallow candles, a low altar with offerings — withered flowers, a silver chalice of dried blood mixed with obscura-derivatives (<em>Medicae</em> or <em>Forbidden Lore (Chaos) (Ordinary +10)</em> to identify). Bulkheads covered in frantic script — prayers to the Prince of Pleasure, written in blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP automatically upon entering. 1 additional CP per 10 minutes spent inside. <em>Psyniscience</em> automatically detects the Slaaneshi aura, no roll required. This room is a CP trap — get in, observe, get out.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Warn observant players with the palpable aura. The escalating CP cost per 10 minutes should discourage lingering. This room exists for atmosphere and to confirm the cult's nature — it is not meant to be looted or studied at length.</p>\n\n<h3>MD4-MD5: Sealed Storage Bay and Medicae Bay [CRITICAL PATH / OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Trap</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Sealed Storage Bay (MD4, CRITICAL PATH) — <em>Security (Hard -20)</em> or <em>Strength (Ordinary +10)</em> to breach. Contains Elisabeth Durst's preserved corpse, eerily intact. <em>Medicae (Challenging +0)</em> reveals self-inflicted death (cut wrists). Her sealed letter confesses to engineering the family's damnation, summoning the entity in the warp drive, and locking the children away — \"The Prince whispered that their fear was sweeter than any offering.\" 1 IP. <em>Logic</em> or <em>Scholastic Lore (Occult) (Ordinary +10)</em> lets Acolytes piece together the full picture: Slaaneshi cult, daemon fused to engine, ship is a warp-lure.</p>\n<p><strong>Traps:</strong> Medicae Bay (MD5, OPTIONAL) — warp-echo surgery plays automatically upon entry (vision of Elisabeth performing ritual vivisection on a screaming crewmember): 1 IP, unavoidable. Mimic-Cabinet — one storage cabinet has been warp-corrupted. <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> before opening detects warmth and moisture on its surface. If opened without caution, fleshy tendrils erupt: Grapple Attack at Strength 40, 1d10+2 R per round to grappled targets. Tendrils: 12 Wounds, no armour, vulnerable to fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Medicae Bay supplies — <em>Search (Ordinary +10)</em> yields 2 doses of de-tox and 1 stimm in sealed stasis-field cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 IP (Elisabeth's letter). 1 IP (medicae bay warp-echo, unavoidable).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Elisabeth's letter is the second essential narrative document (after Gustav's journal). It completes the tragedy. The mimic-cabinet is the first genuine combat-adjacent trap — reward Awareness. The medical supplies are valuable finds in a resource-scarce campaign.</p>\n\n<h3>MD6-MD7: Crew Quarters and Enginarium Access [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Skill Challenge, Trap</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Crew Quarters (MD6) — melancholy atmosphere, personal effects of interrupted lives. Vasily Hent's journal in an unlocked foot-locker (no test required). Reading it grants +10 to <em>Fellowship Tests</em> with the ghost-children (Rose recognizes Vasily's kindness). The journal also contains the power relay sequence for MD7: \"red, blue, green.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Traps:</strong> Sleeping Gas Trap (MD6) — pressure plate between far-corner bunks. <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> to detect; <em>Security (Ordinary +10)</em> to disarm. If triggered: concentrated soporific gas, 5m radius, <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> or 2 levels of Fatigue. Dissipates after 2 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> Power Routing Puzzle (MD7) — three conduit cables (red, blue, green) must be connected to correct relay terminals. Correct sequence: red, blue, green (from Vasily's journal or <em>Logic</em> / <em>Tech-Use (Challenging +0)</em>). Correct: lower deck lumens activate, removing darkness penalties and denying the boss concealment attacks. 1st incorrect attempt: 1d10 E damage to all in corridor, mid-deck lights die for 1d5 rounds. 2nd incorrect attempt: junction blown permanently — lower deck lumens unrestorable, mid-deck lighting becomes intermittent for the rest of the dungeon.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> These two rooms reward thorough, patient players. Vasily's journal provides both narrative texture and concrete mechanical advantages (Fellowship bonus, power sequence). The power routing puzzle significantly affects the boss fight difficulty — solving it correctly is one of the best tactical advantages available.</p>\n\n<h3>MD8: Cargo Hold [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Heavy freight door — <em>Strength (Ordinary +10)</em> to force. The Slaaneshi Tribute Cache: silk that moves in peripheral vision, perfumes of impossible pleasure, disturbing jewellery, and ~200 Thrones in Imperial currency. The cache is not trapped — it is bait. Any item carried inflicts 1 CP per day. <em>Willpower (Ordinary +10)</em> each day to voluntarily discard carried items. The coins are genuine but tainted — they feel warm in the pocket.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Sanctified Incense Censer — tucked in a corner behind a cargo pallet. Contains 3 charges of pre-blessed incense. When lit: 5m radius of purified air for 10 minutes per charge, granting +10 to <em>Willpower Tests</em> against warp phenomena, fear, and psychic attacks. Also disperses warp-echo congregation in LD4 instantly.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP per day for carrying cached items (ongoing).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The tribute cache is a character test — greed has a measurable cost on Barovus. The incense censer is the real treasure here, one of the few genuinely holy items on the vessel. Make sure players can find it even if they are distracted by the shiny cache.</p>\n\n<h3>Descent to Lower Decks [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The entrance is hidden behind a data-slate rack in the captain's quarters — <em>Search (Challenging +0)</em> or deduced from journal references to \"going below-decks.\" Service ladder descends into absolute darkness. Lumens and glow-globes function poorly — light seems heavy, unable to travel more than a few metres. By the twentieth rung, metal gives way to organic warmth. Bulkheads glisten and pulse. The ladder rungs are slick with moisture smelling of copper and perfume.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP upon entering the lower decks (unavoidable). The environment has changed fundamentally — the Acolytes are no longer on a ship. They are inside something alive.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is a threshold moment. The transition from ship to organism should be gradual on the ladder and complete by the bottom. Describe sensory details — warmth, moisture, pulse, smell. The unavoidable CP underscores that the lower decks are qualitatively different from what came before.</p>\n\n<h3>LD1-LD2: The Brig and Engineering Antechamber [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Faith Test</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> The Brig (LD1) — cells lined with organic bulkheads. Two cells still hold skeletal remains in naval uniforms, arranged in positions suggesting prolonged, deliberate suffering. <em>Medicae (Ordinary +10)</em> identifies ritual mutilation consistent with Slaaneshi practices. 1 IP for close examination.</p>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> Engineering Antechamber (LD2) — metal benches (for the congregation), a lectern holding a mouldering Chaos liturgy book. The book is dangerous: <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> to put it down once reading begins. Reading more than a few pages: 1d10 IP and 1d5 CP. An Acolyte with <em>Forbidden Lore (Chaos)</em> can skim safely (1 CP only) and learn the cult sought to summon a \"gift of sensation\" — a daemon bound to the warp drive. The book should be destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 IP (brig remains). Up to 1d10 IP and 1d5 CP (Chaos liturgy book — worst-case).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The liturgy book is the most CP/IP-dense single object in the dungeon. Make the <em>Willpower</em> test to stop reading feel significant — the book is psychically compelling, not merely interesting. Players with Forbidden Lore (Chaos) should be rewarded for having the skill, not punished for using it.</p>\n\n<h3>LD4: Congregation Hall [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Faith Test, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> A space four times the volume the ship's schematics allow — the warp has reshaped it into a cathedral nave. Pews of fused bone and ship's metal. Murals painted in blood depicting the Durst family's fall in five sequential panels, culminating in Slaanesh depicted with a worshipper's adoration. <em>Forbidden Lore (Chaos) (Ordinary +10)</em> identifies the iconography. Studying the murals: 1 CP (psycho-reactive images project sensory impressions).</p>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> 1d5+2 warp-echo figures seated in the pews — translucent spectres frozen in rapturous worship. They are not hostile. They can be dispersed by prayer (1d5 echoes per Imperial devotion spoken aloud), sanctified items (the incense censer disperses all instantly), or violence (effective but feels wrong — they are victims, not threats). Dispersing all echoes peacefully: the hall's psychic weight lifts and each Acolyte regains 1 Fatigue.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP (studying murals).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Reward peaceful dispersal with the Fatigue recovery. Violence works but should feel hollow — these are ghosts of people who made terrible choices, not enemies. The room's impossible geometry reinforces that the warp has fundamentally altered this vessel.</p>\n\n<h3>LD5: Sacrificial Preparation Chamber [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Trap, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> A charnel house — 4m square, bulkheads coated in layered blood applied in deliberate patterns. Metal slab with restraints. Instrument rack: blades, hooks, needles. Entering requires <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or 1d5 IP. Emphasize precision — this was methodical, practised butchery performed by people who believed it sacred.</p>\n<p><strong>Traps:</strong> Pit trap — the drainage grate's support structure has rotted. <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> to notice before stepping on it. If triggered: 3m fall into waste-collection tank, 1d10 I damage, landing in ancient organic residue. <em>Agility (Challenging +0)</em> to climb out.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Ritual Knife — Best-Quality knife, +5 damage, Chaos-tainted. Carrying inflicts 1 CP per day; <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> to voluntarily put down. Glows faintly near warp entities (useful detection tool at a cost). Victim's Escape Map — scratched into the slab's underside. Grants automatic success on all <em>Navigate</em> tests in the lower decks and marks the engine crawlspace (LD6) as an alternative route to the warp drive chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> Up to 1d5 IP (entering the room, failed WP). 1 CP per day (ritual knife, ongoing).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The escape map is the real reward — it enables the flanking route through LD6 and trivializes lower-deck navigation. The ritual knife is a temptation with measurable cost: useful detection ability, escalating corruption. Let players make the choice.</p>\n\n<h3>LD6: Engine Crawlspace — Flanking Route [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Skill Challenge, Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> Navigation through twisting maintenance tunnel — <em>Navigate (Surface) (Challenging +0)</em> or automatic success with the victim's map from LD5. Failure: dead-end alcove, must double back (adds 1d5 rounds).</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Barely wide enough for armoured humans. Complete darkness. Heat: 1d5 E damage per 10 minutes (reduced to 0 with rebreather or protection). Tight confines: -20 to WS and BS, two-handed weapons unusable, -10 to Agility. Power conduit sparks at GM's discretion: <em>Agility (Ordinary +10)</em> to dodge or 1d5 E damage, Pen 2. Claustrophobic Acolytes: <em>Willpower (Ordinary +10)</em> to enter and remain.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Tactical Reward — emerging from the crawlspace places the Acolyte behind the altar-engine. The Lament Configuration does not anticipate this direction. Emerging Acolytes gain a surprise round with +20 to hit on the first round of combat (only if the entity has not been engaged through the main entrance).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is a high-risk flanking route for tactical players. The surprise round bonus is significant — reward the pain of navigating tight, hot, dark tunnels with a meaningful combat advantage. The route is entirely optional but can dramatically change the boss fight's opening.</p>\n\n<h3>LD7: Heart of the Vessel — Hidden Chamber [OPTIONAL]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Only accessible after the altar-engine is destroyed or severely damaged — a concealed bulkhead panel becomes visible as organic growth dies and sloughs away. The original Gellar field generator housing. Clean air, bare metal, uncontaminated. Feels like stepping out of a nightmare.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Portable Gellar Field Modulator — single charge. Creates a warp-ward over a 10m radius for 8 hours: no warp phenomena manifest, +20 to Corruption Tests, warp-touched creatures suffer -10 to all characteristics. Equivalent to a safe campsite on Barovus. One use only, then dead. Stasis Pod — active, containing Vasily Hent (the Enginseer's Mate from MD6's journal). <em>Tech-Use (Ordinary +10)</em> to safely revive. Vasily is confused, terrified, grateful, has been in stasis for ~200 years. He has Tech-Use and Trade (Armourer) skills. Gains 2d10 IP upon revival; <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or breakdown for 1d10 rounds. Potential NPC ally or replacement character hook.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Both finds here are extraordinary. The Gellar modulator is one of the most valuable items in the early campaign — a single guaranteed safe rest on a world where nothing is safe. Vasily is a narrative gift: a living witness, a potential companion, and a backup character hook. This room only opens post-boss, so it rewards victory.</p>\n\n<h3>LD3: Boss Arena — The Lament Configuration [CRITICAL PATH]</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Catastrophic</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Combat, Environmental, Faith Test</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> The Lament Configuration — a Lesser Daemon of Slaanesh fused with the ship's warp drive. WS 45, BS 20, S 45, T 50, Ag 40, Int 30, Per 40, WP 55, Fel 15. Wounds 30, Armour 4 (All). Traits: Daemonic (TB 10 vs non-blessed/non-force weapons), Fear 2, From Beyond, Strange Physiology, Warp Instability. Attacks: Bone-Lash Tendrils (Melee; 1d10+5 R; Pen 2; Flexible, Snare), Psychic Shriek (20m ranged; WP test or 1d10+3 E ignoring armour plus 1 IP). <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3 Acolytes, reduce Wounds to 20 and remove Psychic Shriek cooldown. For 6+, increase Wounds by 10, add +5 to WS and S.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1 (100%-50% Wounds):</strong> Entity fights defensively, using tendrils to grapple and separate. Prioritizes isolating the best-armed Acolyte or the psyker, dragging them toward the altar-engine (contact: 1d5 CP per round). Shrieks when wounded. Cannot leave the warp drive chamber.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2 (50%-25% Wounds):</strong> The altar-engine flares. Simultaneous effects: (1) Warp-Light Surge — all Acolytes: <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> or Stunned 1 round (psykers -10). (2) 1d5 Warp-Echo Cultists manifest — Cultist profiles, half Wounds, Incorporeal (immune to mundane weapons; force/sanctified/psychic attacks deal normal damage). (3) Constricting Chamber — walls close ~1m per round for 3 rounds; <em>Agility (Ordinary +10)</em> per round at edges or 1d5 I damage. Sending-Stone from UD7 can be activated as a Half Action to end all Phase 2 effects, deal 2d10 E (ignoring armour) to the entity, and dissolve cultist echoes (stone crumbles).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 3 (25%-0% Wounds):</strong> Entity fuses deeper into the altar-engine. +10 to all Characteristics, +2 AP (total AP 6). New attacks: (1) Warp Vortex — once per round, Free Action, random Acolyte: 2d10 E, Pen 5; <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or 1d5 CP. Vortex can be attacked (5 Wounds, no armour) or disrupted by prayer (+10 to hit with sanctified weapons). (2) Collapsing Floor — one random 2mx2m section per round; <em>Agility (Challenging +0)</em> or fall for 2d10 E damage, <em>Strength (Ordinary +10)</em> to climb out. In Phase 3, damage to the altar-engine is also dealt to the entity (and vice versa).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The ship turns hostile once combat begins — bulkheads slam shut, corridors constrict, power conduits rupture. <em>Navigate (Surface)</em> or <em>Logic (Challenging +0)</em> to find the way back once the fight starts. The altar-engine: Armour 8, 20 Wounds. Prayer while attacking grants +10 to hit and +2 damage. The entity regenerates in 1d5 rounds unless the altar-engine is also destroyed. In Phase 3, they share a health pool.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> Speaking the children's names (Rose and Thorn) aloud during the fight and calling on them to resist the entity grants all allies +10 to WP tests for the remainder of the encounter (requires the UD7 psychic echo clue or player intuition). The Sending-Stone from UD7 grants +20 to attacks against the altar-engine throughout the fight. Sanctified incense censer grants +10 to WP tests within 5m radius.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 IP per Psychic Shriek hit. 1d5 CP per round of altar-engine contact (Phase 1 drag). 1d5 CP per Warp Vortex hit (Phase 3, failed WP). Fear 2 test on manifestation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This fight is designed to be survivable but harrowing for 4-5 starting Acolytes. The three phases escalate intensity and should be paced accordingly — Phase 1 is a learning phase, Phase 2 is chaos, Phase 3 is desperation. Reward players who found the Sending-Stone, solved the power routing puzzle (lighting removes concealment), used the crawlspace flanking route, or remembered the children's names. Every optional room advantage matters here. After the entity is destroyed, the ship is pulled through the rift — 5 rounds to reach crash stations: <em>Agility (Ordinary +10)</em> per round or 1d10 I from debris, then <em>Navigate (Surface)</em> or <em>Logic (Routine +20)</em> to find a saviour pod. The crash on Barovus is narrative, not mechanical. All survivors gain 100 XP completion bonus.</p>"

Above the main gate, a banner displays smiling citizens beneath a golden sun. The words \"ALL IS WELL IN FORTRESS VALLAK\" are printed in blocky High Gothic.

The outermost ring is a commercial district of shuttered shops and empty market stalls. The middle ring contains hab-blocks packed with the bulk of the population.

Burgomaster Vallakovich believes every word. The town's infrastructure is degraded but functional — a single promethium generator runs at 40% capacity, powering the gate servitors, cogitators, and vox-caster network. Running water is rationed. Food comes from small hydroponic gardens and irregular Vostra trade.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere is one of suffocating tension. Citizens report neighbours for insufficient enthusiasm. Children are drilled in patriotic songs. The mandatory festivals are grotesque spectacles of forced merriment under armed surveillance. And yet, for all its dysfunction, the walls hold, the gate closes at night, and the chapel of Saint Andral still radiates a faint aura of genuine sanctity. To destroy this place would condemn five hundred souls. To leave it as it is perpetuates a regime of fear. The Acolytes will find no easy answers here.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas of Fortress Vallak</h2>\n<h3>The Main Gate</h3>\n<p>A slab of plasteel wide enough for a Chimera to pass through, flanked by two functioning gun-servitors that track all approaches with mindless patience. The gate opens at dawn and seals at dusk without exception. A <strong>servitor-skull</strong> mounted above the gate records all arrivals. Entering requires either legitimate business (a <strong>Challenging (+0) Deceive</strong> or <strong>Fellowship</strong> Test to bluff past the gate guards) or Inquisitorial authority (which draws immediate attention from both Vallakovich and Wachter's spies). After dark, entry requires the Burgomaster's personal authorisation or a <strong>Hard (-20) Security</strong> Test to bypass the gate mechanisms.</p>\n<h3>Blue Water Inn</h3>\n<p>The closest thing to neutral ground in the settlement — a drinking establishment in the outer commercial ring run by the <strong>Martikov family</strong>. The interior is dim, warm, and perpetually hazy with lho-smoke. The bar serves watered-down amasec, thin gruel, and recaf of passable quality. Two floors: the common room below, rented hab-chambers above. A concealed back door leads into a narrow alley used by the Martikovs for discreet exits.</p>\n<p>The Inn functions as the settlement's unofficial information exchange. PDF soldiers on leave, Vostra traders, refugees, and those who need a moment's respite gather here. The Martikovs carefully curate the atmosphere — welcoming enough to loosen tongues, quiet enough that conversations stay private. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Inquiry</strong> Test at the Inn yields rumours about current events, and the Martikovs themselves can provide intelligence about Vallakovich, Wachter, and Van Richten's whereabouts (if the Acolytes earn their trust).</p>\n<h3>Wachterhaus</h3>\n<p>A faded noble estate in the inner ring, maintained with obsessive precision while the rest of the town crumbles. The ground floor is a receiving hall of polished wood and antique furnishings — portrait of the late Lord Wachter above the fireplace, amasec decanters always full, the faint scent of embalming fluid beneath perfume. The upper floors contain Lady Wachter's private chambers and a locked bedroom where she keeps her dead husband's preserved body, speaking to it nightly.</p>\n<p>The <strong>hidden cellar</strong> beneath the wine stores is the true threat. Accessed through a concealed hatch (<strong>Challenging (+0) Awareness</strong> Test to notice, or <strong>Hard (-20) Security</strong> Test to bypass the locks), it contains a crude shrine to Strahd surrounded by ritual implements, Chaos iconography masked as Imperial devotionals, and a collection of bound parchments containing Wachter's correspondence with Strahd's agents. Twelve chairs arranged in a circle — one for each member of <strong>The Devoted</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Chapel of Saint Andral</h3>\n<p>A modest Ministorum chapel in the inner ring, its walls thick stone, its stained-glass windows depicting the martyrdom of Saint Andral in faded colours. The interior is austere: wooden pews, a stone altar, an iron aquila mounted on the wall behind it. <strong>Father Lucian Petrovich</strong> tends the chapel alone.</p>\n<p>While the <strong>Bones of Saint Andral</strong> remain beneath the altar, the chapel and its immediate surroundings are <em>Sanctified Ground</em>: warp entities cannot enter, psychic powers are dampened (-10 to Focus Power Tests within 20m), and all Corruption Tests within the area gain a +10 bonus. The bones have been stolen — the reliquary beneath the altar is empty. Without the bones, the chapel's sanctity will fail within days, leaving it vulnerable to the warp-thralls hiding in the coffin-maker's shop.</p>\n<h3>Market Square</h3>\n<p>The central plaza of the outer ring, dominated by a raised wooden stage used for Vallakovich's mandatory festivals. Vox-casters on every lamp-post broadcast patriotic messages and tinny music on a loop. A massive effigy of the sun — scrap metal painted yellow — stands ready to be ignited at the next festival's climax. The square is ringed by shuttered shops: a pawnbroker (potential location for Dawn's Edge per the Tarot), a scrivener, a chandler, and a coffin-maker's shop operated by <strong>Henrik van der Voort</strong>.</p>\n<p>Henrik's shop is a two-storey building of grey stone. The ground floor displays coffins and funerary supplies. The upper storage area contains <strong>six warp-thralls</strong> hiding in packing crates, waiting for the chapel's sanctity to fail before launching their assault. Henrik himself is a terrified civilian coerced into this arrangement — he barely eats, barely sleeps, and flinches at every sound.</p>\n<h3>PDF Barracks</h3>\n<p>A squat rockcrete structure housing the garrison — approximately 40 PDF soldiers in various states of combat readiness. The barracks contain a small armoury (lasgun charge packs, autogun magazines, flak armour sets, a handful of frag grenades) accessible only with the Burgomaster's authorisation or <strong>Fortress Vallak Armory</strong> faction reward. The garrison's morale is abysmal; the soldiers obey Vallakovich out of habit and fear of Izek Strazni rather than loyalty.</p>\n<h3>The Burgomaster's Manor</h3>\n<p>A former administratum building repurposed as Vallakovich's personal residence and seat of government. Heavy blast doors, barred windows, PDF guards at every entrance. Inside: an audience chamber where Vallakovich holds court, a propaganda workshop where his latest festival plans are designed, and Izek Strazni's private quarters — a room filled with dozens of hand-carved wooden dolls, each bearing an uncanny resemblance to <strong>Ireena Kolyana</strong>. The dolls range from crude early attempts to disturbingly lifelike recent works. Izek permits no one to enter this room.</p>\n<h3>Rictavio's Wagon (Stockyard)</h3>\n<p>In the stockyard district near the outer wall, a gaudy, brightly painted carnival wagon sits among livestock pens and storage sheds. It belongs to <strong>\"Rictavio\"</strong> — Van Richten's flamboyant secondary cover identity. The wagon is reinforced with hidden plasteel plating and contains a warded cage holding a captured minor warp-beast: a daemonic entity bound for study. The wards are functional but aging — if the wagon is damaged or the wards disrupted, the beast escapes into a populated area. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Psyniscience</strong> or <strong>Forbidden Lore (Warp)</strong> Test detects the entity's presence from outside the wagon.</p>"

His eyes betray years of sleeplessness. He speaks in a loud, relentlessly cheerful cadence, as though volume can drown out the screaming in his head. Vallakovich genuinely believes the warp feeds on misery — his festivals are his solution. Each one fails. Each subsequent one must be bigger, louder, more mandatory.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Maintain control, push back the fog through enforced happiness, prove his methods work. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"Are we not BLESSED, Inquisitor? Your very presence proves the Emperor's favour! You will attend the festival, of course. Attendance is not optional.\"</em> He will attempt to co-opt the Acolytes as propaganda tools. If challenged, he becomes hostile. If openly defied, he orders their arrest.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Modified Imperial Commander. WP 40, Fel 35. Not a combatant — his power is entirely political.</p>\n<h3>Izek Strazni</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Violent, obsessive, loyal to Vallakovich. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Dangerous.</p>\n<p>Vallakovich's enforcer and right hand. A massive, scarred brute whose left arm is grotesquely oversized — warp-touched, rippling with muscle and chitinous growths, capable of generating bursts of warp-fire equivalent to a Hand Flamer with unlimited ammunition. He obeys Vallakovich without question and maintains order through intimidation and brutality. He is also obsessed with Ireena Kolyana, having commissioned dozens of dolls in her likeness despite never meeting her.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Serve Vallakovich, find the woman who matches his dolls. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"The Burgomaster says smile. So you smile. Or I make you smile.\"</em> If he sees Ireena, his behaviour becomes erratic — protective, possessive, dangerous. <strong>Profile:</strong> Heavily modified Mutant. WS 50, S 50 (100), T 45, Ag 35, WP 30. Warp-fire attack: Pistol, 10m, S/--/--, 1d10+4 E, Pen 2, Flame.</p>\n<h3>Lady Fiona Wachter</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Composed, articulate, patient, lethal. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Challenging (primarily through her cult).</p>\n<p>A handsome woman of middle years in faded finery, silver hair pinned beneath a lace veil. She smells of amasec and embalming fluid. Fiona is a Chaos cultist of the most insidious variety — not raving and mutated but philosophical and persuasive. She worships Strahd as the rightful sovereign, chosen by powers greater than the God-Emperor. She leads <strong>The Devoted</strong> — approximately twelve citizens who meet in the Wachterhaus cellar for rituals that blend political planning with genuine warp-communion.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Overthrow Vallakovich, install herself as Burgomaster, open the gates to Strahd's direct rule. She believes this will bring order. She is wrong. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"Vallakovich is a madman, Inquisitor. Surely you can see that. I offer stability. I offer sanity. I offer an end to the suffering — is that not what the Emperor would wish?\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Discovering Her Affiliation:</strong> Her Chaos ties are well-hidden. Discovery requires infiltrating Wachterhaus and finding the cellar (<strong>Hard (-20) Security</strong> or <strong>Challenging (+0) Awareness</strong>), interrogating a member of The Devoted (three successful <strong>Inquiry</strong> Tests over several in-game days), or psychic scanning (<strong>Opposed Willpower</strong> vs. WP 45; the psyker suffers 1d5 CP from her minor ward). <strong>Profile:</strong> Modified Cult Leader. Psy Rating 1 (Telepathy or Dominate). The Devoted: Cultist profiles with flak armour and stub revolvers.</p>\n<h3>Inquisitor Van Richten (\"Dr. Richtus\")</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Paranoid, exhausted, brilliant. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Challenging (as a combatant); invaluable (as an intelligence source).</p>\n<p>An elderly Ordo Malleus Inquisitor, stooped by decades of service. One augmetic eye glows faint red. His hands shake from nerve damage. He has been on Barovus for over a decade, entering the warp rift voluntarily. His cover identity — \"Dr. Richtus\" — is a traveling medicae. His secondary cover — \"Rictavio\" — is a carnival master whose wagon hides a caged warp-beast.</p>\n<p><strong>Finding Him:</strong> The Martikovs can point the Acolytes toward Dr. Richtus (<strong>Challenging (+0) Fellowship</strong> Test if they trust the party). Alternatively, investigating Rictavio's wagon leads to his hab-unit. He will not reveal himself willingly — genuine Inquisitorial identification, Ordo Malleus ciphers, or a <strong>Hard (-20) Charm</strong> Test are required. He may attack first if approached without identification.</p>\n<p><strong>Value:</strong> His data-slate contains the most comprehensive intelligence on Strahd in existence: behavioural patterns, weaknesses, thrall identities, partial Spire layout, and his theory that the warp rift is a deliberate construct maintained by Strahd's pact. He provides +20 bonuses to tests related to Strahd's weaknesses and Barovus phenomena. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"You have ten seconds to explain how you found me before I decide whether you are agents of the Inquisition or agents of the Spire. I assure you, I will know if you lie.\"</em></p>\n<h3>The Martikov Family</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Cautious, fundamentally good, hiding a dangerous secret. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Non-combatant (individually).</p>\n<p><strong>Urwin</strong> and <strong>Danika</strong> Martikov run the Blue Water Inn. They carry a stable, heritable warp-mutation — shapeshifting into ravens. They use this ability to spy on Strahd's movements and share intelligence with a loose resistance network. Ravens circling a location often indicate Martikov surveillance. They also operate the Recaf Distillery and are invested in its liberation.</p>\n<p><strong>Complication:</strong> The Acolytes are Inquisitorial agents. Mutants are abominations in Imperial doctrine. How the party handles the Martikovs' nature is a pivotal moral moment. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"We serve the Emperor in our own way, Inquisitor. Judge us if you must — but judge us after you have seen what we do for the people of this world.\"</em></p>\n<h3>Father Lucian Petrovich</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Exhausted, devout, terrified. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Non-combatant.</p>\n<p>The chapel's aging priest, tending Saint Andral's alone. He knows the bones have been stolen and suspects his altar boy, <strong>Milivoj</strong>. He confides in the Acolytes if they demonstrate faith or Inquisitorial authority. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"The Emperor's light still shines here, Acolyte. It is faint — it flickers — but it has not gone out. Not yet. Please... help me keep it burning.\"</em></p>\n<h2>Combat Encounters</h2>\n<h3>The Coffin-Maker's Shop — Warp-Thrall Ambush</h3>\n<p>Henrik's shop contains <strong>six warp-thralls</strong> hiding in packing crates and coffins. They are former citizens, psychically dominated by Strahd, transformed into predatory beings that feed on psychic emanation and blood. The confined space makes this a brutal close-quarters engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Warp-Thrall Combat Profile:</strong> WS 45, BS 20, S 45 (90), T 40, Ag 40, Int 25, Per 35, WP 30, Fel 10. Traits: Unnatural Strength (x2), Fear (1), Dark Sight, Regeneration (3). Weapons: Claws (1d10+5 R, Tearing), Bite (1d10+3 R, Life Drain). Regeneration negated by holy weapons, blessed ammunition, or silver.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactical Notes:</strong> The thralls attack in a frenzied rush when discovered. The shop's narrow corridors and low ceilings limit ranged fire and mobility. Flamers or incendiary weapons are effective but risk setting the building ablaze. If the bones have not been returned to the chapel, surviving thralls flee to attack Saint Andral's at nightfall.</p>\n<h3>Izek Strazni Confrontation</h3>\n<p>If the Acolytes defy Vallakovich or disrupt a festival, Izek arrives with <strong>1d5+2 PDF soldiers</strong> (flak armour, lasguns, WS 30, BS 35). Izek fights with his warp-fire arm and brutal melee strikes. He prioritises the most visibly defiant Acolyte unless Ireena is present — in which case, he attempts to seize her and retreat to the Burgomaster's Manor.</p>\n<h3>Fiona's Coup</h3>\n<p>If triggered, The Devoted (12 cultists: flak armour, stub revolvers, WS 25, BS 30) seize key positions while Fiona confronts Vallakovich. The Acolytes may intervene on either side or attempt to control the chaos. The PDF garrison splits — roughly half remain loyal to Vallakovich, half are uncertain and may side with whoever appears to be winning.</p>"

Strahd can see and hear through any thrall's senses as a Free Action.</li>\n<li><strong>Lady Wachter:</strong> Fiona reports to Strahd's agents, though she considers herself a willing ally rather than a puppet.

The festival is a grotesque spectacle: forced singing, mandatory dancing, garish decorations, and PDF soldiers at every corner ensuring \"maximum enthusiasm.\" Citizens paste on rictus grins. A massive sun effigy of scrap metal is erected in the town square to be set alight at the climax.</p>\n<h3>Festival Outcomes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acolytes do nothing:</strong> The festival proceeds and concludes without incident.

Combat is possible but secondary to the web of investigation, politics, and faith that defines the Acolytes' time here. Every interaction shifts the town's fragile Stability score.

Presenting genuine Inquisitorial authority grants automatic entry but immediately draws attention from both Vallakovich and Wachter. Bribery works — <em>Influence (Ordinary +10)</em> with an appropriate gift (recaf, ammunition, or off-world goods).</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> If refused entry, alternative routes exist. The walls can be scaled — <em>Athletics (Hard -20)</em> — or the supply gate on the eastern side can be bypassed via <em>Stealth (Challenging +0)</em>. Both avoid the political consequences of a formal arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Entry method sets the Acolytes' reputation for the entire Fortress Vallak arc. Inquisitorial authority gets them in fast but makes Vallakovich nervous (he sees a threat to his control) and Wachter interested (she sees a potential weapon). Sneaking in avoids both reactions but limits social options — no one vouches for strangers who arrived without passing the gate. Let the players debate this; it matters.</p>\n\n<h3>Blue Water Inn</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Investigation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> The Martikovs (Urwin and Danika) run the inn and are connected to the Recaf Distillery resistance network. <em>Charm (Ordinary +10)</em> for basic information about the town's politics and daily life. <em>Inquiry (Challenging +0)</em> to access the rumour table — seeds for four or more locations and quest chains. The Martikovs know about the stolen reliquary bones, the Wachter problem, and the distillery crisis, but only share if they trust the Acolytes (<em>Fellowship (Challenging +0)</em> with bonuses for demonstrated opposition to Strahd).</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> Rictavio (Van Richten in disguise) is a regular patron — a flamboyant carnival master who keeps to the corners. <em>Awareness (Hard -20)</em> to notice he is more than he seems: his hands are a soldier's hands, his eyes track exits, and his laughter never reaches his gaze.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Quality recaf — genuine, not the swill found elsewhere on Barovus. The inn has a supply line through the Martikovs' distillery connections. A town notice board near the entrance is plastered with Vallakovich's propaganda: \"ALL IS WELL\" festival announcements, mandatory attendance notices, and rewards for reporting \"insufficient enthusiasm.\"</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the primary information hub for Fortress Vallak. Every major quest chain can be seeded here — bones of Saint Andral, Van Richten's identity, Wachter's plotting, the distillery crisis, PDF morale. Do not dump everything at once. Spread rumours across multiple visits. Let the Martikovs warm to the Acolytes gradually. Their shapeshifter nature (stable warp-mutation, raven forms) is a time bomb — if puritanical Acolytes discover it, they face a doctrine-versus-pragmatism crisis.</p>\n\n<h3>Wachterhaus</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense / Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Investigation, Social, Trap</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Lady Fiona Wachter presents herself as a cultured moderate — anti-Vallakovich, sympathetic to the common people, dangerously reasonable. <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> to detect her subtle probing of the Acolytes' beliefs and loyalties during conversation. She offers alliance against the Burgomaster: her contacts, her estate as a safe haven, her knowledge of local politics. Every word is calculated.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> Upper floors are a normal noble house — faded finery, Imperial portraiture, nothing overtly suspicious. The cellar is another matter. Locked door — <em>Security (Hard -20)</em> to bypass, or <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> to notice the concealed entrance. Below: a cult shrine with an eight-pointed star, ritual implements, and the preserved corpse of her dead husband, whom she speaks to nightly as though he were sleeping.</p>\n<p><strong>Trap:</strong> Warp ward on the cellar door. <em>Psyniscience (Challenging +0)</em> to detect the ward before triggering it. If triggered without detection: <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or suffer 1d10 IP from psychic backlash.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> If her cult allegiance is discovered and she is confronted, Wachter summons reinforcements from hidden passages. 4 Cultists (Chaos Cultist profile, Challenging threat). Armed with flak armour and stub revolvers. <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3, reduce to 3 cultists. For 6+, add 2 cultists and Wachter fights directly (use Chaos Cultist Leader profile, Psy Rating 1 — Telepathy or Dominate).</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 2 CP for witnessing the cellar shrine — the eight-pointed star, the candles, the unmistakable taint of deliberate Chaos worship in the heart of an Imperial settlement. 1d5 IP from the preserved husband — he looks peaceful, cared for, and that wrongness is worse than any corpse.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Wachter is more dangerous as an ally than as an enemy. Her coup attempt happens regardless of the Acolytes' actions — the question is whether they enable it, oppose it, or are blindsided by it. The cellar is the proof needed to condemn her, but accessing it risks the ward trap and triggers her contingency. If exposed, she does not panic — she accelerates the coup. Think three moves ahead when playing Fiona.</p>\n\n<h3>Chapel of Saint Andral</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Faith Test, Investigation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> The chapel is consecrated ground — one of the few genuine sanctuaries remaining on Barovus. <em>Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) (Ordinary +10)</em> confirms the blessings are authentic Imperial consecration, not warp-mimicry. Prayer here: <em>Willpower (Ordinary +10)</em>, success removes 1d5 IP. However, the bones of Saint Andral (the reliquary that powers the consecration) have been stolen. Without them, the protection is failing — and will collapse entirely when Strahd's agents attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> <em>Inquiry (Challenging +0)</em> with Father Lucian Petrovich reveals the bones were stolen recently. He suspects the altar boy. <em>Inquiry (Hard -20)</em> or <em>Intimidate (Challenging +0)</em> with altar boy Yeska reveals Milivoj stole them on behalf of Henrik the coffin-maker. <em>Intimidation (Ordinary +10)</em> or <em>Charm (Challenging +0)</em> with Milivoj confirms and names Henrik directly. This chain leads to the Coffin-Maker's Shop.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> If the bones are recovered from the Coffin-Maker's Shop and returned to the chapel, it becomes a true safe haven: warp entities cannot enter, all WP tests within gain +10, and prayer-based IP healing is doubled. This is one of the most strategically valuable positions in the entire campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is a quest chain: Chapel → altar boy → Milivoj → Coffin-Maker → bones. Each link can be skipped with good rolls but the intended pacing builds dread. Returning the bones is a significant strategic victory — Strahd knows this and may attack the chapel during the Festival of the Blazing Sun to force the Acolytes out of position. Time the bone recovery against the festival calendar for maximum tension.</p>\n\n<h3>Coffin-Maker's Shop</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Combat, Investigation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> Henrik van der Voort is terrified, not hostile. <em>Intimidate (Ordinary +10)</em> or <em>Charm (Challenging +0)</em> makes him talk. He was coerced by Strahd's agents — warp-thralls hiding in his shop — to steal the bones and store them. He knows the thralls are upstairs. He begs the Acolytes not to go up there. He is correct to be afraid.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> 6 Warp-Thralls hidden in shipping crates on the upper floor. They trigger when the Acolytes investigate upstairs, bursting out in waves — 2 per round for 3 rounds. 6 Warp-Thralls (Warp-Thrall profile: WS 45, S 45, T 40, Ag 40, Per 35, WP 30; Unnatural Strength x2, Fear 1, Dark Sight, Regeneration 3; Dangerous threat). <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3, reduce to 4 total (waves of 2+1+1). For 6+, add 2 for 8 total (waves of 3+3+2).</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Saint Andral's bones (reliquary) are in a lead-lined crate among the coffin supplies. Henrik's rambling confession, if pressed, reveals details about Strahd's network of informants throughout Fortress Vallak — the thralls are just the violent arm of a much larger surveillance apparatus.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 2 CP from proximity to massed warp-thralls in a confined space. The psychic pressure of six dominated predators packed into crates is nauseating even before they attack.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Classic horror set-piece. The shop is cramped — no room for tactical manoeuvre, no clean firing lanes, furniture everywhere. Warp-thralls burst from crates without warning. Play up the sound of splintering wood before each wave. Henrik cowers behind the counter and is useless in combat. If the thralls win, they proceed to attack the chapel at nightfall — the bones were the only thing holding them back.</p>\n\n<h3>PDF Barracks</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Skill Challenge</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> The Planetary Defence Force garrison is demoralised, under-equipped, and running on fumes. <em>Command (Challenging +0)</em> or <em>Charm (Hard -20)</em> to rally them and establish rapport. Presenting Inquisitorial authority forces compliance but creates simmering resentment — they answer to Vallakovich, and outside authority threatens the chain of command they cling to.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> <em>Logistics (Ordinary +10)</em> to assess their armory: standard-issue autoguns, a few grenade launchers, limited ammunition, mismatched flak armour. <em>Persuasion (Hard -20)</em> to requisition supplies — 1d10 autogun clips, 1 grenade launcher with 3 rounds. This depletes their reserves visibly and the quartermaster will remember.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Morale reports on the commander's desk reveal increasing desertion rates. Several PDF troopers have gone missing — some deserted into the wilds (suicidal), some were \"reassigned\" by Vallakovich to unknown duties that no one can specify. The missing soldiers are a thread that leads nowhere good.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The PDF are a potential military asset but require leadership. If rallied, they can defend locations, create diversions, or provide fire support during major events (festival, chapel attack, coup). But they are terrified, exhausted, and their commander answers to Vallakovich first. Pulling them into the Acolytes' orbit risks destabilising the town further.</p>\n\n<h3>Burgomaster's Manor</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Investigation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Burgomaster Vargas Vallakovich — paranoid, authoritarian, relentlessly positive in a way that makes skin crawl. He speaks in a booming cadence of forced cheer, stuffed into a PDF uniform tailored for a thinner man. <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> reveals he is not evil — just desperately afraid, coping through denial, and one bad day from complete breakdown. His son and enforcer, Izek Strazni, is the real danger: violent, warp-mutated left arm (oversized, chitinous, capable of generating warp-fire equivalent to a Hand Flamer with unlimited ammunition).</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> <em>Awareness (Hard -20)</em> finds Izek's secret room: dozens of hand-carved dolls, every one depicting Ireena Kolyana with eerie accuracy. He has never met her. <em>Psyniscience (Challenging +0)</em> detects faint warp-resonance — Izek has a psychic connection to Ireena he does not understand, possibly a past-life echo or the warp's cruel mockery of fate.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Vallakovich's festival schedule and propaganda materials. Izek's doll collection — deeply, profoundly unsettling. Administrative records in the study reveal \"special taxes\" funding unknown construction projects that have no corresponding output.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1d5 IP from Izek's doll room — the wrongness is not in any single doll but in the obsessive repetition, the loving craftsmanship, the fact that every face is Ireena's and Izek cannot explain why. 1 CP if an Acolyte touches a doll (warp-resonance pulses through the contact).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Vallakovich is a tragically human villain — a man so afraid of the dark he burns everything to create light. His festivals are not malice; they are desperation calcified into policy. Izek is the real danger and the real horror. The doll room should make players' skin crawl — describe each doll individually, the slight variations in expression, the way the eyes seem to follow. If the Acolytes have Ireena with them, the resemblance is unmistakable and Izek will become fixated on her.</p>\n\n<h3>Van Richten's Quarters</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Investigation, Social, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Van Richten (disguised as \"Dr. Richtus\") must be identified first. <em>Inquiry (Hard -20)</em> cross-referencing Inquisition records and local rumours, or <em>Awareness (Very Hard -30)</em> to spot his concealed Inquisitorial rosette during conversation. Once identified, trust must be established — <em>Charm (Hard -20)</em> combined with proof of Inquisitorial authority (operational codes, Ordo Malleus ciphers, or a genuine rosette). He holds a laspistol that does not quite tremble, and he means to use it if trust fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> Van Richten's hab-unit is a decade of obsessive research made physical: hand-drawn maps, transcribed vox-intercepts, autopsy sketches, and dense handwritten analyses connected by coloured thread in a web that might be brilliant or might be madness. His data-slate contains the most comprehensive intelligence on Strahd in existence — behavioural patterns, known weaknesses, thrall identities, partial Zarovich Spire layout. He knows about the three relics needed to destroy Strahd: Dawn's Edge, Rosette of Saint Markovia, and the Heart of the Spire.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> This is <strong>Lost Expedition Site 5: Van Richten's Lost Retinue.</strong> Hidden in a locked case (<em>Security (Hard -20)</em>, or Van Richten gives the key if he trusts the Acolytes): Interrogator Holt's tactical analyses of Strahd, Sage Duma's Empyrean Vault field notes (partial map, +10 Navigate in the Vault), and a pressed flower from a world they will never see again.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Interrogator Holt's Data-Slate:</em> \"He was civilised. Charming. He asked about my homeworld, about the orchards there, about the taste of the fruit. For a moment — the God-Emperor forgive me — for a moment I forgot what he is. That is how he does it. Not with claws. Not with sorcery. With conversation.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Discovery — The Pressed Flower:</strong> Among Holt's effects, a single pressed flower — xenos-petal, from a garden world in the Calixis Sector. A reminder of sunlight. The Acolytes will recognise it for what it is: proof that someone carried hope into this place, and hope was not enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 IP from the emotional weight of seeing how Van Richten's companions died one by one over decades — their belongings catalogued, their fates recorded in his cramped handwriting, each loss a line in a ledger of grief.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Van Richten is the most valuable ally in the campaign — but he is paranoid, brittle, and damaged by years of isolation. He will not accompany the Acolytes to the Zarovich Spire (he has tried twice and lost people both times). His data-slate is the single most important non-artifact item in the campaign. The pressed flower should be a quiet moment of human connection amid the horror. Do not rush it. Let silence do the work.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas of Krezk and the Biologis Facility</h2>\n<h3>Krezk Village</h3>\n<p>A cluster of stone hab-units huddled behind a low wall on the mountainside. The village gate is always sealed and manned by two nervous civilians with autoguns they barely know how to use. Burgomaster <strong>Dmitri Krezkov</strong> refuses entry to outsiders unless they can offer something of genuine value: medical supplies, news from outside, or a solution to a local problem. Alternatively, Abaron may invite the Acolytes directly if he learns of their presence, eager for news and new subjects to study.</p>\n<p>The village marketplace trades in mountain herbs, animal pelts, and desperation. A narrow path behind the settlement leads to the <strong>Sacred Pool</strong> — a natural spring-fed pool in a rocky courtyard surrounded by weathered Imperial statues. The water is unnaturally clear and carries a faint golden luminescence visible only in darkness.</p>\n<h3>Reception and Triage (Ground Floor)</h3>\n<p>The Facility's entrance hall retains a veneer of Mechanicus order: tiled floors (cracked), directional signage in binharic and Low Gothic (faded), a reception cogitator (non-functional). A single mongrelfolk orderly shuffles forward to greet visitors, its words coming with difficulty through a mouth not designed for speech. The air carries the chemical tang of counterseptic, recaf, and something organic and sweet that catches in the throat.</p>\n<p>A triage assessment chamber adjoins the reception — a room of medical slabs and diagnostic equipment that is genuinely functional. Abaron uses this room to evaluate new patients and, less openly, to assess their potential as experimental subjects. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Awareness</strong> or <strong>Medicae</strong> Test reveals that some of the diagnostic tools have been modified beyond their standard specifications — biometric scanners that record genetic data in unusual detail, neural probes calibrated for psychic sensitivity testing.</p>\n<h3>Operating Theatres (Ground Floor)</h3>\n<blockquote><p>The operating theatre occupies the Facility's central bay, a vast chamber that was once a sterile laboratory and is now something between a surgical suite, an art gallery, and an abattoir. Vats of translucent amniotic fluid line the walls, each containing a shape in some stage of growth — here a torso, there a cluster of organs pulsing with mechanical regularity, in the far corner something that is almost a face and is trying very hard to become one. Cogitator banks hum with the processing load of a dozen simultaneous biological simulations. The floor is obsessively clean, but the air carries the sweet-copper scent of blood and the ozone tang of active augmetics.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Three operating tables occupy the centre of the room, each equipped with restraint systems and an array of surgical mechadendrites mounted on articulating arms. Two tables are empty. The third holds a mongrelfolk in the process of having a crude bionic eye installed — the subject is conscious and appears to be in considerable distress but does not cry out. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Medicae</strong> Test confirms the surgical technique is brilliant but the methodology is heretical — Abaron has abandoned Mechanicus rites, standard anaesthesia protocols, and basic ethical constraints.</p>\n<h3>Vat Chambers (Ground Floor, Rear)</h3>\n<p>A long gallery of floor-to-ceiling glass tanks filled with bubbling amniotic fluid. Each tank contains a biological experiment in various stages of development: cloned organs, hybrid tissue samples, failed homunculi curled in foetal positions, and one tank — sealed and triple-warded — containing something that pulses with a faint warp signature. A <strong>Hard (-20) Psyniscience</strong> Test identifies the warded tank's contents as warp-infused biological material — the raw substrate from which the Bride's psychic receptivity is being developed. Standing near this tank for more than 10 minutes requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Willpower</strong> Test or inflicts 1 Corruption Point.</p>\n<h3>Mongrelfolk Quarters (Ground Floor, East Wing)</h3>\n<p>A converted dormitory housing Abaron's approximately 30 mongrelfolk — his failed experiments, his servants, his congregation. The room is clean but deeply disturbing: rows of cots sized for wildly different body configurations, a communal feeding trough, crude but heartfelt shrines to the Omnissiah built from medical waste. The mongrelfolk worship Abaron with absolute devotion. Many can speak, though with difficulty. Some are lucid enough to provide information about the Facility, Abaron's routines, and the Bride's status. They will not betray Abaron willingly.</p>\n<p>Each mongrelfolk has 1d3 unique mutations or augments (telescopic eyes, extra arms, built-in vox units, wall-crawling ability, etc.) and an implanted <strong>compliance device</strong> that allows Abaron to issue commands as a Free Action. Removing a device requires a <strong>Hard (-20) Medicae</strong> Test and deals 1d10 damage to the subject.</p>\n<h3>Abaron's Private Laboratory (Upper Floor)</h3>\n<p>Accessible via a secured lift (<strong>Challenging (+0) Tech-Use</strong> or <strong>Security</strong> Test to bypass without Abaron's permission). The upper laboratory is Abaron's sanctum: pristine, temperature-controlled, humming with power. A central surgical slab dominates the room, surrounded by cogitator arrays running biological simulations of staggering complexity. Shelves hold specimen jars, data-slates filled with centuries of research, and a collection of curiosities — items with unusual energy signatures that Abaron studies without comprehending their spiritual significance. The <strong>Rosette of Saint Markovia</strong> may be among these curiosities (Tarot-dependent).</p>\n<p>On the central slab, under a halo of surgical lumens, lies the <strong>Bride</strong>. She is beautiful. She is perfect. She is the most disturbing thing the Acolytes have ever seen, because she is clearly, unmistakably not alive — and yet she breathes. The Bride is a vat-grown body of extraordinary physical perfection, grown from gene-samples harvested from the women of Krezk. She is intended as a vessel for Tatyana's soul — a gift to Strahd that Abaron believes will satisfy his obsession and end the curse.</p>\n<h3>Sacred Pool Courtyard</h3>\n<p>Behind and below the village, accessible via a narrow mountain path, a natural spring feeds a pool in a rocky clearing. Weathered statues of Imperial saints surround the pool, their features softened by centuries of wind and rain. The water is unnaturally clear and faintly luminous. This is a site of genuine residual sanctity — not as powerful as a consecrated chapel, but enough to grant +5 to Willpower Tests against corruption while within 10 metres of the water.</p>\n<p>If <strong>Ireena</strong> accompanies the Acolytes to the pool, the water reacts to her presence (see GM Reference for the full event sequence).</p>"

His mechanical components are beautifully maintained — polished chrome, precision-calibrated servo-arms, optical arrays of extraordinary resolution. His remaining organic tissue, however, is mutating: patches of luminous growth beneath translucent skin, fingers that have fused and split into new configurations, a face that is half handsome and half something that belongs in a specimen jar. He speaks in measured Mechanicus cadences, lacing his speech with binharic code-bursts that convey emotions he cannot express in Gothic.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Complete the Bride to satisfy Strahd and end the curse on Barovus. Continue his research without interference. Maintain his self-identity as a loyal servant of the Omnissiah. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"You misunderstand, Acolyte. I am not creating an abomination. I am iterating toward perfection. Each failure brings me closer to the divine configuration. Is that not the Omnissiah's own method — trial, error, refinement, truth?\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Combat Profile:</strong> WS 45, BS 40, S 45, T 50, Ag 30, Int 75, Per 45, WP 55, Fel 20. Wounds: 25. AP 6 all locations (mechanical body). Weapons: 4x Mechadendrites (1d10+5 R each, may attack with all 4 as Full Action), integrated laspistol, injector claw (1d10+3 R plus Toxin — target must pass Toughness Test or -20 to all Tests for 1d10 rounds). Traits: Mechanicus Implants, Multiple Arms (4), Dark Sight. Special: Can command up to 6 mongrelfolk as a Free Action; Flesh-Warp touch attack (target must pass Toughness Test or suffer 1d10 damage and gain a temporary mutation); Emergency Self-Repair (once per encounter, Full Action, restores 1d10+5 Wounds).</p>\n<h3>The Mongrelfolk</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Pitiable, devoted to Abaron, some are willing to help outsiders secretly. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Routine to Ordinary (individually); dangerous in groups.</p>\n<p>Abaron's failed experiments — human beings surgically and genetically modified into grotesque configurations. Extra limbs, misplaced organs, composite faces, crude mechanical grafts without anaesthetic or proper integration. Many can speak. They worship Abaron with the fervour of those who have nothing else. Their loyalty is absolute and heartbreaking.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Widely variable. WS 20-35, S 25-40, T 30-40, Ag 20-35. Wounds: 8-15. Each has 1d3 unique mutations/augments and an implanted compliance device. Not effective individually but approximately 30 in total — overwhelming numbers if provoked. Some — particularly one called <strong>\"Clovin\"</strong>, a lucid mongrelfolk with a mechanical voice box — may secretly pass information to the Acolytes if treated with kindness. Clovin knows Abaron's schedule, the Bride's location, and the weakness in the compliance devices.</p>\n<h3>The Bride</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Unconscious, incomplete, tragic. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> None (currently).</p>\n<p>A vat-grown body of extraordinary physical perfection on Abaron's central slab. She breathes but has no consciousness — a shell waiting for a soul. If completed and presented to Strahd, the consequences are catastrophic: Strahd attempts to transplant Tatyana's soul into the Bride, an act that either fails spectacularly (psychic backlash devastating the Spire) or succeeds in creating a warp-tainted vessel that Slaanesh can directly inhabit.</p>\n<p>The Bride can be destroyed, which enrages Abaron and permanently denies Strahd this option. Alternatively, the Acolytes can sabotage the process subtly (<strong>Hard (-20) Medicae</strong> or <strong>Tech-Use</strong> Test) so that the Bride appears complete but will fail upon activation — a more strategic choice that avoids immediate confrontation with Abaron.</p>\n<h3>Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Protective, grieving, pragmatic. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Non-combatant.</p>\n<p>The village leader. A quiet, broad-shouldered man who lost his son to one of Abaron's \"treatments\" and now exists in a state of cold resignation. He cooperates with Abaron because the village has no alternative for medical care. He will help the Acolytes if they offer genuine assistance to Krezk. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"The Magos keeps us alive. That is not the same as keeping us human. But when the alternative is death, you learn to accept the distinction.\"</em></p>\n<h2>Combat Encounters</h2>\n<h3>Confronting Abaron</h3>\n<p>If the Acolytes attempt to destroy the Bride or directly challenge Abaron's work, he fights. He is accompanied by 2d5 mongrelfolk servants who obey his commands without question. The Facility's corridors are narrow and filled with surgical equipment — improvised cover but also environmental hazards. Vats can be shattered (splash damage: 1d5 Toxic to anyone within 2m), mechadendrite arms on the walls can be triggered by Abaron to grasp at intruders (<strong>Challenging (+0) Agility</strong> to avoid, or become Grappled).</p>\n<h3>Mongrelfolk Uprising (Optional)</h3>\n<p>If the Acolytes remove compliance devices from several mongrelfolk or kill Abaron, the mongrelfolk react unpredictably. Some become confused and non-hostile. Others, freed from control but still mentally damaged, may lash out. A few — the more lucid ones — may rally to the Acolytes' side. This should be played as a chaotic, morally complex scene, not a simple combat encounter.</p>"

He has cultivated Abaron over centuries, nudging the Magos toward the Bride project through carefully placed suggestions and \"donations\" of genetic material. He monitors the Facility through servitor-skulls and through Abaron himself, who communicates with Strahd's agents via encrypted vox-channels (he considers this administrative correspondence, not collaboration).</p>\n<p>If Ireena visits the Sacred Pool, Strahd intervenes directly — the lightning strike and his echoing voice are a personal manifestation of his will, not a pre-set trap. This is one of the few moments where Strahd loses his composure. His voice carries genuine fury and desperation. The Acolytes should understand that they have witnessed something rare: Strahd afraid.</p>\n<p>Following the Sacred Pool event, Strahd increases surveillance of the Acolytes dramatically. Servitor-skulls appear at every rest stop. Letters arrive with greater frequency. He may send Warp-Thralls to test the party's readiness — not to kill, but to probe.</p>"

Magos Abaron is cordial, helpful, and utterly insane — and the horror lies in how reasonable he sounds. The Sacred Pool scene is one of the campaign's dramatic pivots. Pace the facility exploration to build dread before the pool's tranquillity-to-catastrophe transition.</p>\n\n<h3>Village Gate</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Skill Challenge</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov refuses entry to outsiders unless they offer something of genuine value. The standard favour: delivery of recaf or wine from the Recaf Distillery (Location 08), tying this location to that quest chain. If the Acolytes have already liberated the Distillery, entry is automatic. Otherwise: <em>Charm (Hard -20)</em> with a compelling personal appeal, or <em>Command (Challenging +0)</em> invoking Inquisitorial authority (effective but resented — Krezk has learned that Imperial officials bring trouble).</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> Alternative entry via mountain paths bypasses the village entirely. <em>Navigate (Hard -20)</em> to find the route, then <em>Athletics (Challenging +0)</em> to traverse it. This arrives at the Biologis Facility directly, skipping the village and its resources but avoiding the favour quest.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Krezk is isolated, suspicious, and has exactly one hundred reasons (its population) to distrust strangers. The favour quest creates a natural link to the Recaf Distillery — use it to drive exploration if the Acolytes have not yet visited. If they bypass the village, they miss the mongrelfolk rumours and the belladonna, so signal that the mountain approach has trade-offs.</p>\n\n<h3>Biologis Facility</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Investigation, Environmental, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Body horror throughout. The facility's central operating theatre is part surgical suite, part art gallery, part abattoir: vats of amniotic fluid containing shapes in various stages of growth, flesh-grafted servitors shambling through corridors, and the half-complete Bride on the central slab — beautiful, perfect, breathing, and unmistakably not alive. <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> to endure the sensory assault or suffer 1d5 IP.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> <em>Tech-Use (Ordinary +10)</em> to recognise standard Mechanicus field equipment among Abaron's tools bearing expedition designation \"Epsilon-9\" — equipment from a Mechanicus survey team that arrived approximately 160 years ago. The equipment is not stored or displayed. It is <em>integrated into his work.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> This is <strong>Lost Expedition Site 4: Tech-Priest Epsilon-9's Equipment.</strong> A data-core containing the expedition's final survey readings and the Magos's personal log.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Magos Epsilon-9-Theta, Final Entry:</em> \"The readings are conclusive. This is not a storm. Not a rift. Not a natural phenomenon of any catalogued classification. It is a construct. Someone — or something — <strong>built this cage.</strong> The energy signatures are self-sustaining, recursive, and they respond to psychic stimuli. The Lord-Governor has been accommodating. Too accommodating. He asks the wrong questions. He wants to know what we have found. Not what we recommend. I am transmitting this log to the survey ship. If you are reading this, we did not return.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 2 CP from the facility — unavoidable corruption from prolonged exposure to warp-tainted biologis work permeating every surface. 1d5 IP from the Bride specifically — her perfection is the worst part, the uncanny valley made flesh.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Abaron is cordial and helpful — a perfect host who offers medical attention, information, and shelter. That is the horror. He genuinely believes his work serves the Omnissiah and will discuss it freely, seeing no reason to hide what he considers problem-solving. The Epsilon-9 discovery confirms the warp rift is artificial and raises the question: did Abaron consume the previous expedition? Their equipment is woven into his work. He will not acknowledge this if asked directly — he has rationalised it away entirely.</p>\n\n<h3>Sacred Pool</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil → Catastrophic</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Faith Test</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Faith Test (Tranquil Phase):</strong> A natural spring at the village's edge with genuine spiritual power — golden light in the water, a sense of peace that is almost painful after the unrelenting horror of Barovus. <em>Willpower (Ordinary +10)</em> to pray. Success: a vision of Sergei's face in the water, a blessing, and 2d10 IP reduction — one of the most powerful healing effects in the campaign. If Ireena is present, Sergei's spirit reaches for her through the water. A moment of peace. A young man in ancient Imperial officer's regalia, reaching with desperate recognition.</p>\n<p><strong>Faith Test (Catastrophic Phase):</strong> Then Strahd intervenes. The pool boils. Warp-lightning splits the sky. Strahd manifests at full power — not to fight the Acolytes, but to take Ireena. His voice echoes across the mountainside: <em>\"She is MINE.\"</em> If Ireena touched the water, she is partially drawn into the warp. <em>Willpower (Very Hard -30)</em> for Ireena to resist, or the Acolytes must physically intervene. <em>Hard (-20) Willpower</em> for all witnesses or suffer 1d10 IP (1d5 on success).</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1d10 CP if Strahd appears — proximity to a major warp entity at the height of his fury. The vision itself is healing (reduces IP) but the transition from grace to horror compounds the psychological damage.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is one of the most dramatic scenes in the campaign. The transition from peace to terror must be instant — mid-sentence if possible. One moment Sergei is reaching for Ireena, the next the water is boiling and the sky is screaming. If Ireena is lost here (drawn into the warp, taken by Strahd), that is one of the four Ireena fate outcomes. Do not soften it. The cruelty is the point — this is what Strahd does to hope.</p>\n\n<h3>Mongrelfolk Warrens</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Abaron's failed experiments — still alive, hiding in tunnels beneath the facility. Approximately 30 mongrelfolk with surgically and genetically modified bodies: extra limbs, misplaced organs, composite faces, crude mechanical grafts. They are afraid but not hostile. <em>Charm (Hard -20)</em> or offering food and medicine to earn trust. Their leader, Otto, speaks with difficulty through a mouth not designed for speech but has valuable intelligence about Abaron's true scope of work.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Otto can provide maps of the facility's hidden sub-levels — chambers Abaron did not show the Acolytes. Evidence of far more extensive experimentation than Abaron admits. One mongrelfolk has a functioning bionic eye of a quality too advanced for Abaron's claimed capabilities — it bears Epsilon-9 expedition markings, raising the question of its original owner.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP from proximity to extensive warp-tainted mutation. The mongrelfolk worship Abaron with the fervour of those who have nothing else — he made them, he feeds them, and in their eyes he is working to save them all. Their loyalty is absolute and heartbreaking.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The mongrelfolk are sympathetic NPCs in a horror setting. They did not choose this. Otto's information is valuable but requires earning trust through kindness, not intimidation — <em>Intimidate</em> tests automatically fail here, as the mongrelfolk are already so afraid that more fear simply makes them hide. Play up the tragedy: these are people, not monsters, and Abaron does not see the difference between success and failure in his work.</p>\n\n<h3>Mountain Approach</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Skill Challenge, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> <em>Medicae (Challenging +0)</em> or <em>Survival (Ordinary +10)</em> to identify belladonna nocturnis growing in mountain crevices. When properly prepared (<em>Medicae (Challenging +0)</em> or <em>Chem-Use (Challenging +0)</em>), it produces a tincture granting +10 to Willpower tests to resist warp corruption for 1d5 hours (also causes -5 to Agility-based tests for the duration — mild nausea). A single foraging expedition yields 2d5 doses of raw material.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> The mountain vista reveals the geography of Barovus from above. The warp-fog boundary is visible — a wall of roiling mist encircling the entire world, a cage seen from within. <em>Navigate (Ordinary +10)</em> to update maps with settlement positions, road networks, and the visible extent of the rift boundary.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> A rare moment of peace. Let the players breathe before or after the facility's horrors. The vista is simultaneously beautiful and devastating — a reminder of the scale of their imprisonment. The belladonna is a meaningful mechanical reward (anti-corruption tincture) that rewards exploration and preparation. Don't skip the quiet moments; they make the horror land harder.</p>"

Commander Gorev led thirty Astartes and auxiliary PDF units in a campaign that lasted months and ultimately failed. Strahd, newly empowered by his daemonic pact, destroyed the Silver Drakes to the last man. Their outpost — erected as a forward operating base — stands as their tomb.</p>\n<p>The outpost is haunted. Not by random warp-echoes or psychic phenomena, but by the actual revenants of fallen Astartes — spirits bound to the material world by unfinished duty, righteous anger, and the sheer refusal of Astartes will to accept failure, even in death. They stand vigil in silent ranks, patrol corridors they died defending, and maintain a garrison that serves no living commander. For the Acolytes, this place is both a potential sanctuary and a trial: the Silver Drakes will aid those who prove worthy of their respect, but their standards are the standards of the Adeptus Astartes, and they do not lower them for mortals.</p>\n<p>This location carries the tone of tragic nobility — the grandeur of the Imperium's greatest warriors reduced to ghosts guarding an empty fortress on a forgotten world. It should evoke awe, sorrow, and the bitter question: if even Space Marines could not defeat Strahd, what chance do a handful of Acolytes have? The answer, as Commander Gorev will tell them, is that the Silver Drakes lacked one of three necessary elements. The Acolytes can succeed where the Silver Drakes failed — if their faith is absolute.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas of the Fallen Astartes Outpost</h2>\n<h3>The Courtyard</h3>\n<p>A wide, open space of cracked rockcrete and packed earth, littered with the debris of a battle fought centuries ago: spent bolter casings corroded green with age, fragments of ceramite armour, the rusted remains of combat blades. A banner pole stands in the centre, its banner long since rotted away. The wind makes a sound through the empty buildings that is almost, but not quite, a voice.</p>\n<p>The revenants are here. They do not immediately manifest — the Acolytes see them as peripheral flickers, half-glimpsed shapes in Mark VII power armour standing at attention or walking patrol routes. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Psyniscience</strong> or <strong>Awareness</strong> Test confirms the psychic residue is immense — this entire compound is saturated with the imprint of thirty Astartes who refused to accept death. The atmosphere is heavy, oppressive, and strangely reverential. This is not a haunted ruin. It is a shrine.</p>\n<p>The revenants will not interfere with the Acolytes in the courtyard unless provoked. Desecrating the outpost (defacing the chapter icon, looting openly without respect, using warp-powers casually) draws an immediate hostile response — the revenants manifest fully and demand the intruders leave. Failure to comply results in psychic assault: all Acolytes within the courtyard suffer a <strong>Hard (-20) Willpower</strong> Test or take 1d10 Energy damage (warp) and are forcibly expelled through the gate.</p>\n<h3>The Barracks</h3>\n<p>Two long hab-structures flanking the courtyard. The interiors are empty but preserved with eerie precision — bunks made with military corners, equipment lockers sealed, personal effects arranged with parade-ground order. Dust does not settle here. The air is cold but clean. Each bunk bears a name-plate in High Gothic: the names of the thirty Silver Drakes who died on Barovus.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Challenging (+0) Scholastic Lore (Imperial)</strong> or <strong>Common Lore (War)</strong> Test allows an Acolyte to identify the name-plates as a roster of the strike force. Cross-referencing with any available records (Van Richten's data-slates contain fragmentary references) confirms the Silver Drakes were a Codex-compliant chapter with a reputation for tenacity and faith-driven warfare. Their loss on Barovus is not recorded in any surviving Imperial archive — the chapter itself may have assumed the strike force was lost in the warp.</p>\n<h3>The Armoury and Relic Vault</h3>\n<p>A reinforced structure at the rear of the compound, its blast doors sealed but not locked — they open with a grinding protest when pushed. The armoury proper has been mostly looted over the centuries: empty weapon racks, depleted ammunition crates, disassembled heavy weapons stripped of critical components. The smell of old gun oil and sacred unguents lingers.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Hard (-20) Search</strong> Test reveals a <strong>hidden compartment</strong> behind a false wall panel (triggered by pressing the Silver Drake chapter icon in a specific sequence — a <strong>Challenging (+0) Logic</strong> or <strong>Common Lore (Adeptus Astartes)</strong> Test to deduce). The compartment contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2d5 Astartes bolt rounds</strong> (blessed, +10 damage against warp entities)</li>\n<li>A <strong>combat knife of exceptional quality</strong> (Best Craftsmanship mono-edged, 1d10+3 R, Pen 2)</li>\n<li>A <strong>data-crystal</strong> containing the Silver Drakes' complete tactical analysis of their campaign against Strahd — invaluable intelligence that grants +10 to all tests related to planning the assault on the Zarovich Spire</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>relic vault</strong> — a gene-locked inner chamber — may contain <strong>Dawn's Edge</strong> (Tarot-dependent). Opening the vault requires a Space Marine's gene-seed (impossible under normal circumstances) or a <strong>Very Hard (-30) Tech-Use</strong> Test to bypass the biometric lock. Commander Gorev can open it if he judges the Acolytes worthy.</p>\n<h3>The Chapel</h3>\n<p>Dedicated to the Emperor, the chapel is the spiritual heart of the outpost and the site of the <strong>Trial of Faith</strong>. It is a simple space: stone walls, an altar of black marble bearing a tarnished but intact aquila, rows of stone benches worn smooth by centuries of phantom congregants. A faint golden light emanates from the altar — residual sanctity that persists despite everything. The chapel and its immediate surroundings function as weak Sanctified Ground: warp entities suffer -5 to all Tests within 10 metres, and Corruption Tests gain +5.</p>\n<p>The stained-glass windows depict scenes from the Silver Drakes' history: their founding, their victories, and — in the final window, shattered and crudely repaired with lead — their last stand on Barovus. The repaired window shows Commander Gorev, recognisable even in abstract glass, standing alone against a figure of shadow and cold fire. The figure is Strahd.</p>\n<h3>The Strategium</h3>\n<p>The Silver Drakes' command centre, located in the outpost's central building. A circular room dominated by a hololith projector table (non-functional — the power cells died centuries ago) surrounded by cogitator banks (also dead). The walls are covered in faded tactical maps of Barovus, annotated in precise Astartes notation.</p>\n<p>A pict-slate beneath a fallen rafter contains fragmentary records of the campaign against Strahd — tactical analyses, after-action reports, and a final, desperate entry from Commander Gorev:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\"He cannot be killed by mortal arms alone. The blade must be sanctified. The light must be pure. The faith must be absolute. We had two of three. Emperor forgive us.\"</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>This entry is critical intelligence. It confirms the three-element requirement for Strahd's destruction (Dawn's Edge, the Rosette, and absolute faith) and reveals that the Silver Drakes came agonisingly close to success. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Scholastic Lore (Tarot)</strong> or <strong>Logic</strong> Test connects this entry to the Emperor's Tarot reading — the three relics the Acolytes seek correspond to what the Silver Drakes lacked.</p>\n<h3>The Beacon Tower</h3>\n<p>The outpost's highest point — a cylindrical tower rising above the compound walls, crowned by a large apparatus of polished lenses, psycho-reactive crystal arrays, and focusing mechanisms. This is the <strong>Silver Drake Beacon</strong>: a device designed to project a concentrated beam of psychoactive faith-energy visible for hundreds of kilometres. It is non-functional. Its power source — a skull carved from psycho-reactive crystal, pulsing with the residual faith of a long-dead Chapter Master — was taken from the outpost after the Silver Drakes fell.</p>\n<p>The apparatus itself is intact and can be examined with a <strong>Challenging (+0) Tech-Use</strong> Test. The focusing mechanisms are sound. The crystal arrays are undamaged. All it needs is its heart — the Chapter Master's skull — and a psyker to channel the activation sequence.</p>"

He appears as a translucent figure in battered Mark VII power armour — a massive figure even by Astartes standards, with a face carved from stone and eyes that burn with cold fire. His voice carries the weight of centuries of unfinished duty. He does not appear immediately upon the Acolytes' arrival; he observes them from the chapel, judging their conduct and intent before revealing himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> See Strahd destroyed and his battle-brothers' mission completed. Find mortals worthy of the task the Silver Drakes could not finish. Maintain the honour of his chapter. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"We came to this world with bolter and blade and the Emperor's fury. It was not enough. Strahd von Zarovich broke us — not through greater strength, but through a darkness that our weapons could not cut. We had the blade. We had the faith. We did not have the light.

Unlike Gorev, Vladimir has been driven insane by centuries of undeath. He does not want Strahd destroyed. He wants Strahd to <em>suffer</em> — to exist forever in his cursed state, trapped and miserable, as punishment for what he did to the Silver Drakes. In Vladimir's twisted logic, killing Strahd would be a mercy, and mercy is the last thing the monster deserves.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Ensure Strahd suffers eternally. Prevent anyone from granting Strahd the release of death. Maintain his grip on the lesser revenants who follow him. <strong>Dialogue Hooks:</strong> <em>\"You would END him? You would grant him PEACE? No. No! He destroyed us. He broke our chapter's honour. He murdered thirty brothers of the Emperor's own design. And you would let him DIE? Death is too kind. Let him rot in this prison he built. Let him hunger and rage and remember what he lost — FOREVER. That is justice. That is what the dead deserve.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Combat Profile (if it comes to violence):</strong> Vladimir is a revenant with Astartes Chaplain characteristics. WS 65, BS 50, S 55 (110), T 55 (110), Ag 40, Int 45, Per 50, WP 70, Fel 35. Wounds: 40. Spectral ceramite armour (AP 10 all locations, immune to mundane weapons — only holy, blessed, force, or psychic attacks deal full damage; mundane weapons deal half damage). Weapons: Spectral Crozius Arcanum (Melee, 2d10+12 E, Pen 8, Power Field, Holy — deals double damage to warp-touched entities), Spectral bolt pistol (Pistol, 30m, S/2/--, 1d10+9 X, Pen 5, Tearing, Blessed). Traits: Fear (3), Unnatural Strength (x2), Unnatural Toughness (x2), From Beyond, Incorporeal (can phase through solid matter). He is accompanied by 1d5+2 lesser revenants (WS 50, S 45, T 50, Wounds 25, spectral bolters and combat blades).</p>\n<h3>The Lesser Revenants</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Divided — some follow Gorev's honourable pragmatism, others follow Vladimir's bitter obsession. <strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Challenging (individually); Severe (in groups).</p>\n<p>Approximately 30 revenant Space Marines haunt the outpost. They manifest as translucent figures in Mark VII power armour, moving through patrol routines and garrison duties with mechanical precision. Most are silent. A few murmur prayers to the Emperor in voices like wind through broken glass. They are divided between Gorev's faction (those who wish to see their mission completed) and Vladimir's faction (those consumed by hatred).</p>\n<p>The lesser revenants will not attack the Acolytes unless provoked or ordered to by Vladimir. If the Acolytes prove worthy through the Trial of Faith, Gorev's faction stands down entirely and may provide passive assistance (opening doors, pointing out hidden areas, warding against warp intrusions). Vladimir's faction remains hostile and must be dealt with separately.</p>\n<h2>The Trial of Faith</h2>\n<p>Entering the chapel triggers the trial. The revenants of the Silver Drakes manifest, forming ranks in the nave — thirty spectral Astartes in full battle gear, their bolters held at port arms, their eyes burning with cold judgement. Commander Gorev manifests at the altar and demands the Acolytes justify their presence.</p>\n<h3>Mechanical Resolution</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Psychic Endurance:</strong> Each Acolyte must pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Willpower</strong> Test to withstand the psychic pressure of thirty angry Astartes revenants. Failure inflicts 1d5 Insanity Points and the Acolyte is visibly shaken (-10 to Fellowship Tests for the remainder of the trial).</li>\n<li><strong>The Speech:</strong> One Acolyte (chosen by the party or the GM) must address Commander Gorev and explain their mission, their devotion to the Emperor, and their plan to destroy Strahd. This is resolved as a <strong>Hard (-20) Fellowship</strong> or <strong>Command</strong> Test. The GM should grant bonuses for genuine roleplaying effort (+10 to +20 for an impassioned, in-character speech), for presenting evidence of their mission (Inquisitorial rosette, Van Richten's intelligence, recovered relics), and for demonstrating knowledge of the Silver Drakes' sacrifice (+5 per relevant fact cited).</li>\n<li><strong>Judgement:</strong> On success, Gorev declares the Acolytes worthy. The revenants salute — a spectral crack of ceramite gauntlets striking chest-plates — and stand aside. On failure, the revenants dismiss the Acolytes as unworthy and they are expelled from the chapel. No damage, but the shame is significant. They may attempt the trial again after accomplishing a notable deed against Strahd's forces.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Vladimir's Opposition</h2>\n<p>If the Acolytes attempt to activate the Beacon or seek Gorev's full blessing, Vladimir intervenes. He manifests in the Beacon Tower or chapel with 1d5+2 lesser revenants, blocking the way. He does not attack immediately but delivers a furious, unhinged tirade about how Strahd must suffer, not die.</p>\n<h3>Resolution Options</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> A <strong>Very Hard (-30) Fellowship</strong> Test. Vladimir is an Astartes Chaplain and will not be easily swayed. Arguments based on the Emperor's will or the honour of the Silver Drakes have the best chance. Success convinces him to stand aside (but not to help). Failure enrages him further.</li>\n<li><strong>Combat:</strong> Vladimir is a formidable opponent (see combat profile above). Defeating him does not destroy him permanently — he reforms in 1d5 days — but it removes his opposition for the immediate objective.</li>\n<li><strong>Gorev's Intervention:</strong> If the Acolytes have Gorev's full support and have proven themselves through significant deeds, Gorev confronts Vladimir directly. The two revenants engage in a spectral duel — the outcome depends on whether the Acolytes have sufficiently impressed Gorev (GM discretion). If Gorev prevails, Vladimir retreats in bitter silence.</li>\n<li><strong>Creative Solutions:</strong> The GM should reward creative approaches — invoking the Silver Drakes' chapter oaths, presenting evidence that Strahd's destruction will cause more suffering than his continued existence, or appealing to Vladimir's buried sense of duty rather than his dominant rage.</li>\n</ul>"

He makes destroying the Beacon a priority, likely sending a major force against the outpost (2d5 Warp-Thralls, 1d5 Elite Guards, possibly led by a personal lieutenant).

Strahd is aware of the outpost's existence and its haunted nature, but he does not fear the ghosts — they cannot leave the compound, and their hatred is impotent without living agents to act on their behalf. He considers the outpost a monument to his victory.</p>\n<p>This changes dramatically if the Beacon is activated. The pillar of faith-light is a direct challenge to Strahd's dominion — visible, symbolic, and mechanically damaging to his forces. He responds with escalating force:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Within hours:</strong> Servitor-skulls arrive to assess the situation. Strahd sends a letter to the Acolytes via bat-servitor: <em>\"I congratulate you on repairing an antique. I trust you understand that antiques, however beautiful, are fragile things.\"</em></li>\n<li><strong>Within one day:</strong> A raiding force of Warp-Thralls and Elite Guards probes the outpost's defences.</li>\n<li><strong>Within three days:</strong> A full assault force arrives. If the Acolytes are present, this is a major combat encounter. If they have moved on, the Beacon may fall without their defence (GM discretion based on narrative pacing — the revenants fight but cannot hold indefinitely against physical enemies they struggle to harm).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strahd himself does not attack the outpost. The revenants' psychic presence makes him uncomfortable — not afraid, but uncomfortable, like a man returning to the site of a crime he does not regret but cannot forget. If confronted here during a personal visit, he is uncharacteristically terse and leaves quickly. This is one of the few locations on Barovus where Strahd is not entirely at ease.</p>"

Everything here is built to transhuman scale — doorways the Acolytes walk through without ducking, weapons they can barely lift, armour that weighs more than they do. The horror is not corruption but failure: if the Emperor's Angels could not win here, what chance do Inquisitorial Acolytes have? Play the scale. Play the silence. Play the grief.</p>\n\n<h3>Courtyard</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> War debris preserved by centuries of stillness — spent bolter casings corroded green, fragments of ceramite armour, the rusted remains of combat blades, claw marks gouged into adamantium walls. <em>Scholastic Lore (War) (Ordinary +10)</em> or <em>Forbidden Lore (Adeptus Astartes) (Challenging +0)</em> identifies Silver Drakes Chapter markings: a winged serpent coiled around a sword, partially defaced by time and deliberate vandalism.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> A bolter round embedded in the courtyard wall — unfired, magazine-fresh, somehow pristine after centuries as though the outpost itself preserved it. <em>Ballistic Skill test</em> to extract without damaging it. Yields 1 bolt round — incredibly valuable by Barovus standards, and blessed by proximity to Astartes faith.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 IP upon entering the courtyard. Seeing evidence of Astartes defeat — the shattered ceramite, the scale of the destruction, the knowledge that beings engineered for war by the Emperor Himself fell here — is profoundly demoralising. If <em>they</em> could not win, what can mortal Acolytes hope to achieve?</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The outpost should feel like a tomb from the first step. Everything is built for transhumans — oversized doorframes, weapon racks at shoulder height for a being three metres tall, chairs that make the Acolytes feel like children. The silence is oppressive. The wind makes sounds through the empty buildings that are almost, but not quite, voices. Set the atmosphere here and maintain it throughout.</p>\n\n<h3>Armoury</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Skill Challenge, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> Main weapons locker — <em>Security (Hard -20)</em> to open the sealed mechanism, corroded but intact. Secondary cache is gene-locked to Astartes biometrics. <em>Tech-Use (Very Hard -30)</em> to attempt the gene-lock — this CANNOT be opened (the attempt reveals the cache exists and that the lock responds only to Astartes bio-signatures), but the attempt itself is informative. The gene-lock's refusal is absolute and silent, a reminder that these weapons belonged to something superhuman.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Main locker contains: 2 bolt pistol magazines (6 rounds each — 12 rounds total, an extraordinary find), 1 frag grenade (Astartes-pattern, +2 damage over standard Imperial issue), 1 combat knife (mono-edged, Best Craftsmanship quality). These items are among the most valuable equipment available on Barovus.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The gene-locked secondary cache is a deliberate dead end and a worldbuilding moment. Astartes equipment is made for Astartes — the Imperium's weapons are not interchangeable across its servants. Let the players feel the frustration and the awe. The accessible loot is still extraordinary by Barovus standards; impress upon them what 12 bolt rounds mean in a world where autogun magazines are treasures. The Astartes blessed bolt rounds found in the hidden compartment (2d5 rounds, +10 damage vs warp entities) require a <em>Search (Hard -20)</em> to locate.</p>\n\n<h3>Strategium</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Investigation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> The Silver Drakes' command centre. Cogitator banks are dead but a pict-slate beneath a fallen rafter contains fragmentary recordings of the Chapter's final days. <em>Tech-Use (Challenging +0)</em> to recover data. The recordings show a methodical, professional military retreat that devolved into chaos over weeks. Each pict-capture is more degraded and desperate than the last. The final entry shows Commander Gorev ordering the beacon activated — his voice steady, his face carved from stone, his eyes already knowing it would not be enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Strategic maps of Barovus from 200+ years ago — settlement positions, road networks, terrain analysis, daemon incursion patterns. Some locations have changed; some have not. Possessing these maps grants +10 to all <em>Navigate</em> tests on Barovus. Also recovered: Gorev's final tactical assessment — <em>\"He cannot be killed by mortal arms alone. The blade must be sanctified. The light must be pure. The faith must be absolute. We had two of three. Emperor forgive us.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The recordings should be presented as fragmentary pict-captures — visual static, audio distortion, moments of clarity amid degradation. The Astartes were not panicking, which makes it worse. They were losing with perfect discipline, every tactical withdrawal textbook-correct, every last stand conducted with honour. Professional soldiers dying professionally. The Gorev quote is a critical clue about the three relics — let the players parse it themselves.</p>\n\n<h3>Chapel</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Faith Test, Social, Combat</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> The Chapel of the Silver Drakes still holds residual sanctity. <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> to pray. Success: 1d10 IP reduction and a vision of the Chapter's last stand — thirty Astartes holding the line, falling one by one, never breaking. Failure: 1d5 IP from psychic backlash of centuries of compressed grief echoing through the chapel stones.</p>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> The Silver Drake revenants manifest — translucent figures in battered Mark VII power armour, forming ranks in the nave. 3 Space Marine Revenants issue the Trial of Faith: three questions about duty, sacrifice, and the Emperor. These are roleplayed, not rolled. Good answers demonstrate genuine understanding of Imperial faith and the weight of sacrifice. Correct answers (judged by the GM based on roleplaying): the revenants stand down and offer their blessing — +10 WP for 24 hours, a gift of immeasurable value. Wrong answers: combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies (if combat):</strong> 3 Space Marine Revenants — WS 55, S 60, T 55, 25 Wounds each, degraded Power Armour (AP 6). Heavily degraded but still lethal — they are slow but hit with transhuman force. <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3, reduce to 2 revenants. For 6+, add 1 revenant and increase all Wounds to 30.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 2 CP from warp-animated Astartes remains — these were the Emperor's finest, and something has denied them rest. IP varies based on outcome: the blessing brings catharsis, combat brings grief.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The Trial of Faith should be roleplayed, not reduced to a dice roll. Ask each Acolyte directly: Why do you serve the Emperor? What would you sacrifice? What is duty when hope is gone? Good answers are not rehearsed catechisms — they are honest, human responses from characters who have seen what Barovus does to faith. The revenants are tragic figures: honourable warriors denied rest by unfinished duty. If blessed, the Acolytes carry the Silver Drakes' legacy forward. That should feel like weight, not a bonus.</p>\n\n<h3>Beacon Tower</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense / Catastrophic</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Skill Challenge, Combat</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> <em>Tech-Use (Very Hard -30)</em> to repair and activate the Astartes beacon — a large apparatus designed to project focused psychoactive energy visible for hundreds of kilometres. Requires 3 successful tests (can be spread across multiple characters and multiple rounds). If the Silver Drake relic (psycho-reactive crystal skull) has been recovered and installed, reduce difficulty to <em>Challenging (+0)</em> for the final test and add a psychic channelling requirement: any psyker, <em>Psyniscience (Ordinary +10)</em>. The beacon can send a signal beyond the warp rift — a long-term campaign hook for Imperial aid, not immediate rescue.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Commander Vladimir's revenant guards the beacon. He has been driven mad by centuries of undeath — he does not want Strahd destroyed, he wants Strahd to <em>suffer</em> eternally as punishment for the Silver Drakes' destruction. He believes activating the beacon will end Strahd's torment, which he considers unacceptable mercy. 1 Revenant Champion (Vladimir) — WS 65, S 65, T 60, 35 Wounds, spectral thunder hammer equivalent, degraded Power Armour AP 7. He delivers a furious tirade before attacking. <em>Fellowship (Very Hard -30)</em> to reason with him — possible but extremely difficult. <strong>Scaling:</strong> Vladimir is a solo boss. For 3, reduce Wounds to 28. For 6+, increase Wounds to 40 and add a sweep attack hitting all adjacent targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 3 CP if Vladimir is destroyed — he was a loyal Chaplain of the Emperor, driven mad by grief and unending duty. Killing him is a corruption-inducing necessity. 2 CP if the beacon is activated — channelling warp energy through the apparatus exposes the operator to raw immaterium.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Vladimir is the most sympathetic enemy in the outpost. He is not wrong — the beacon DOES channel warp energy, and ending Strahd could be seen as mercy for a monster who deserves eternal suffering. This is a genuine moral dilemma, not a combat encounter with a moral veneer. If the Acolytes can articulate why Strahd must be destroyed (for Barovus, for the Imperium, for duty) rather than merely defeated, Vladimir may falter — but he will not yield easily. His 1d5+2 lesser revenants may also intervene, blocking the approach. Creative solutions (bypassing Vladimir, reasoning with Gorev to countermand him, channelling the revenants' collective will) should be rewarded.</p>"

The twelve standing stones — xenos in origin, their provenance unknown — serve as amplifiers, focusing warp energy into a concentrated upwelling that manifests as perpetual reality distortion. Time flows strangely here: minutes may pass as hours, or hours as seconds. Colours shift without source. Shadows move independently of light. The air tastes of copper and ozone, and the ground itself seems to breathe.</p>\n<p>The Warp-Tree is a manifestation of Strahd's subconscious — a psychic echo of a tree from his original homeworld, from a garden where he once knew peace. The warp has corrupted it into a living conduit that channels immaterium energy into realspace. As long as the Tree stands, Strahd's control over the landscape of Barovus is strengthened. Sacred Seed #1, stolen from the Recaf Distillery, is embedded in the Tree's root system, feeding its unnatural growth. This directly links the Nexus to the Distillery quest chain — recovering the seed requires destroying or severely damaging the Tree.</p>\n<p>The cultists gathered here are the <strong>Nature-Corruption Devotees</strong> — desperate humans who have abandoned the Imperial Creed in favour of worshipping the warp as a primal force of transformation. They are not sophisticated heretics; they are broken people who chose to embrace mutation rather than die fighting it. Their leader, the massive mutant warlord <strong>Wintersplinter</strong>, was once human — now a three-metre monstrosity of bark-like skin, root-tendril limbs, and a face that is half-man, half-tree. The Devotees are attempting a twelve-hour summoning ritual that, if completed, will tear a permanent warp-gate into realspace, flooding Barovus with daemonic entities beyond any settlement's ability to withstand. The Acolytes must stop them.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas</h2>\n<h3>A. The Approach — Fog-Choked Hillside</h3>\n<p>The Warp Nexus sits one travel segment from the Recaf Distillery, reached by a cross-country route through corrupted woodland. The final approach is a steep, treeless hillside — the vegetation refuses to grow within two hundred metres of the stones. The ground is a vitrified crust that crunches underfoot and occasionally gives way to soft, fleshy pockets that leak warmth. Fog clings thickly to the lower slopes but thins near the summit, replaced by the shimmering heat-haze of concentrated warp energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Paths:</strong> Four rough trails climb the hill from each cardinal direction. The southern approach offers the most cover (scattered boulders and dead stumps), while the northern approach is the steepest but shortest. Cultist sentries (2 per path) patrol the lower slopes during the ritual — <em>Challenging (+0) Stealth</em> Test to bypass them, or <em>Ordinary (+10) Awareness</em> to detect them first. If a sentry spots intruders, they raise the alarm with a ululating warp-touched cry that carries unnaturally far, alerting Wintersplinter and the ritual circle within 1d5 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental Hazard:</strong> The vitrified ground is treacherous. Moving at full speed requires an <em>Ordinary (+10) Agility</em> Test or the Acolyte stumbles, taking 1d5 Impact damage from the razor-sharp glass-like crust. The warp saturation intensifies as the Acolytes climb — upon reaching the stone circle perimeter, every Acolyte must pass an <em>Ordinary (+10) Willpower</em> Test or gain 1 Insanity Point from the sheer wrongness of the environment.</p>\n<h3>B. The Stone Circle — Twelve Xenos Monoliths</h3>\n<p>Twelve standing stones form a rough circle approximately forty metres in diameter at the hilltop. Each stone is carved from a material that defies classification — neither stone, metal, nor crystal, but something that shifts subtly between all three depending on the angle of observation. Alien sigils cover every surface, deeply incised and still sharp-edged despite their apparent antiquity. The sigils glow faintly, cycling through colours that have no names in Low Gothic. Each stone is warm to the touch and vibrates at a sub-audible frequency that sets teeth on edge and makes augmetic components flicker.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ritual:</strong> One Nature-Corruption Devotee stands at each stone, chanting in a pre-Gothic language. The ritual requires twelve cultists chanting for twelve hours, one per stone. Removing a cultist from a stone by any means — killing, incapacitating, dragging them away — disrupts the ritual for 1d5 rounds but does not end it permanently. A new cultist can take the vacated position. To permanently neutralise a stone, the Acolytes must <strong>cleanse</strong> it: place a sanctified object at its base (an Aquila pendant, blessed ammunition, holy water) or have a psyker channel a Sanctification rite (<em>Hard (-20) Willpower</em> Test). A cleansed stone goes dark and silent. Three or more cleansed stones end the ritual permanently.</p>\n<p><strong>The Vision Quest:</strong> Any psyker who touches a standing stone — or any Acolyte who touches the Warp-Tree — receives an overwhelming psychic vision of Strahd's pact with Slaanesh. The vision is vivid, immersive, and indistinguishable from reality for 1d5 rounds. It shows a young officer kneeling before a mirror that reflects not his face but the visage of a Daemon Prince — beautiful, terrible, and vast beyond comprehension. The young man speaks: <em>\"I accept. Give me what I desire, and I am yours.\"</em> The garden dies. The tree bleeds. The sky darkens. And Strahd von Zarovich stands, no longer young, his eyes the eyes of something that will never die and will never stop hungering.</p>\n<p>The vision inflicts <strong>1d10 Corruption Points</strong> and <strong>1d5 Insanity Points</strong>, both halved (round down) on a successful <em>Hard (-20) Willpower</em> Test. It also grants critical intelligence: the nature of Strahd's pact (Slaanesh), the moment of its inception, and the price he paid (his humanity, his world, everything). This information is invaluable for the campaign's endgame.</p>\n<h3>C. The Warp-Tree — Heart of the Nexus</h3>\n<p>The Tree dominates the summit. Twenty metres tall, its trunk wider than a Leman Russ battle tank, its branches spread against the sky like the grasping fingers of a drowning man. It is made of wood and meat and something else — a substance that shifts between organic and mineral, pulsing with a slow, rhythmic cadence like a heartbeat. Sap the colour of old blood seeps from cracks in its bark, and where it drips, the ground writhes with tiny, boneless things that are born, suffer, and die in seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Seed #1</strong> is embedded in the Tree's root system, visible as a faintly golden glow beneath the bark at the Tree's base. Recovering it requires destroying the Tree or severing its warp connection (see GM Reference for mechanics).</p>\n<p><strong>Root-Tendrils:</strong> The Tree is immobile but not passive. Any creature within 5 metres is subject to lashing root-tendrils: <strong>S 50, 1d10+8 I damage, Flexible</strong>. The tendrils attack reflexively — the Tree has no tactical awareness but reacts to proximity.</p>\n<p><strong>Warp Saturation:</strong> The air within the stone circle is so thick with warp energy that unprotected psykers suffer Psychic Phenomena on any doubles when using powers, not just matching tens digits. Non-psykers who spend more than 30 minutes within the circle without warp protection must test for Corruption (<em>Challenging (+0) Willpower</em> or gain 1d5 CP per 30 minutes).</p>\n<h3>D. The Ritual Clearing</h3>\n<p>A flat area between the stone circle and the Tree's trunk serves as the Devotees' camp. Crude shelters of hide and warp-warped wood, a central fire pit burning with violet flame that gives heat but no light, and offerings piled at the Tree's base: dead animals, severed human limbs, and crude icons shaped from fused bone. <strong>Wintersplinter</strong> typically stands guard here, a towering sentinel of bark and sinew, unmoving unless the alarm is raised.</p>\n<p>If the Acolytes approach stealthily and observe, they can count the cultists, identify Wintersplinter's position, and plan their assault. An <em>Ordinary (+10) Scrutiny</em> Test reveals that three of the chanting cultists appear to be flagging — exhausted by hours of sustained ritual. These three are the weakest links and could be removed with minimal resistance.</p>"

Most bear minor mutations: extra fingers, discoloured skin, eyes that glow faintly in darkness, vestigial growths. They wear ragged robes over emaciated bodies and fight with crude weapons: autoguns held together with wire, blades of fused bone, and their own mutated limbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Use Cultist profiles with the following modifications: +5 WP (sustained warp exposure has hardened their minds), minor random mutation (roll once on the Minor Mutation table per Devotee), and <em>Resistance (Fear)</em> — they have seen too much to be frightened by anything mortal.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactics:</strong> The ritual cultists will not willingly leave their stones. They fight from their positions, calling for aid rather than abandoning the chant. Reserve Devotees mob intruders in groups of 3-4, attempting to overwhelm with numbers. If Wintersplinter falls, morale collapses — surviving Devotees must pass a <em>Challenging (+0) Willpower</em> Test or flee into the fog.</p>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> The Devotees cannot be reasoned with through conventional means. They believe the warp is the natural order and the Imperium is the aberration. However, an Acolyte who succeeds on a <em>Very Hard (-30) Charm</em> or <em>Intimidate</em> Test can shake the faith of an individual Devotee long enough to pull them from their stone — they will not fight, but collapse weeping. This approach costs 1 Insanity Point to the Acolyte who attempts it, as the Devotee's broken worldview is genuinely pitiful.</p>\n<h3>Wintersplinter — Mutant Warlord</h3>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Guardian of the Tree, territorial, animalistic intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Severe</p>\n<p>Wintersplinter was once a man — a farmer, perhaps, or a labourer. Now it is a three-metre hulk of bark-armoured flesh, its limbs replaced by root-tendril appendages of terrible strength, its face split vertically between something recognisably human and the grooved, sap-weeping surface of living wood. It does not speak, but it understands Low Gothic and responds to the Devotees' commands with grunting compliance. It is utterly devoted to the Tree and will fight to the death to protect it.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Use a modified <strong>Chaos Spawn</strong> profile with the following adjustments:</p>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>WS</th><th>BS</th><th>S</th><th>T</th><th>Ag</th><th>Int</th><th>Per</th><th>WP</th><th>Fel</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody><tr><td>Value</td><td>55</td><td>--</td><td>60 (180)</td><td>55</td><td>25</td><td>15</td><td>30</td><td>35</td><td>--</td></tr></tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Wounds:</strong> 60 | <strong>Armour:</strong> Natural Armour (AP 4 all) | <strong>Movement:</strong> 3/6/9/18</p>\n<p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Root-Tendrils (Melee; 2d10+18 I; Pen 2; Flexible, Snare), Slam (Melee; 1d10+18 I; Concussive [2])</p>\n<p><strong>Traits:</strong> Fear (2), Unnatural Strength (x3), Natural Armour (4), Size (Enormous), Dark Sight, Bestial</p>\n<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Entangling Roots:</strong> All Acolytes within 10 metres of Wintersplinter must pass a <em>Challenging (+0) Agility</em> Test each round or become Immobilised until they spend a Full Action cutting free (Strength Test at +0 or appropriate weapon attack against the root, TB 4, Wounds 8).</li>\n<li><strong>Regeneration (5):</strong> Wintersplinter recovers 5 Wounds at the start of each turn. Fire damage negates this regeneration for 1 round. Severing the Tree's warp connection permanently ends Wintersplinter's regeneration.</li>\n<li><strong>Tree-Bond:</strong> While the Warp-Tree stands, Wintersplinter gains +10 to all Characteristics and its Regeneration increases to 8. Destroying the Tree causes Wintersplinter to howl in agony and lose all bonuses immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tactics:</strong> Wintersplinter charges the nearest threat and attempts to Immobilise as many enemies as possible with Entangling Roots before focusing on isolated targets with its Slam attack. It does not pursue fleeing enemies beyond the stone circle perimeter — it will not leave the Tree undefended. If reduced below 20 Wounds while the Tree still stands, it retreats to the Tree's base and fights from within the root-tendril zone, using the Tree's own attacks as additional defence.</p>\n<h3>Encounter Phases</h3>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 — Disruption:</strong> The Acolytes engage the outer sentries and begin cleansing or clearing stones. Devotees at the stones resist but do not abandon their posts. Wintersplinter activates and moves to intercept. Reserve Devotees attack from the camp.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 — The Warlord:</strong> Wintersplinter engages in full melee. The Tree's root-tendrils lash at anyone within range. If three or more stones are cleansed, the ritual energy destabilises — warp phenomena occur at random (roll on the Warp Phenomena table each round, affecting a random combatant).</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3 — Collapse:</strong> When Wintersplinter is destroyed or the Tree is severed/destroyed, the remaining Devotees break. The warp energy dissipates visibly — the shimmering heat-haze fades, the stones go dark, and for the first time, natural wind blows across the hilltop. If Sacred Seed #1 is recovered, it glows with a warm golden light that is physically painful for warp-touched creatures to approach.</p>"

The Tree is immobile and does not dodge or parry, but its root-tendrils (S 50, 1d10+8 I, Flexible) lash reflexively at anything within 5 metres. Fire damage is doubled against the Tree. Blessed or holy weapons ignore its TB entirely.</p>\n<p><strong>Psychic Severance:</strong> A psyker may attempt an <em>Extended Opposed Willpower Test</em> against the Tree's WP 60. The psyker must accumulate 3 Degrees of Success before the Tree accumulates 3. Each round of the contest, the psyker suffers 1d5 CP from direct warp exposure (no save). Success severs the Tree's connection — it withers and dies over 1d5 rounds, releasing Sacred Seed #1 without the explosive warp surge of physical destruction.</p>\n<h3>Loot and Items</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sacred Seed #1:</strong> A small, golden seed that radiates warmth and faint light. Warp-touched creatures cannot approach within 2 metres. When replanted at the Recaf Distillery, it partially restores the crops' anti-corruption properties.</li>\n<li><strong>Xenos Stone Fragment:</strong> If an Acolyte chips a fragment from a standing stone (<em>Hard (-20) Strength</em> or appropriate tool), the fragment retains residual psychic properties. A psyker carrying it gains +5 to Psyniscience Tests but suffers nightmares (1 IP per week of possession). Worth significant value to the Ordo Xenos if the Acolytes ever leave Barovus.</li>\n<li><strong>Wintersplinter's Core:</strong> A fist-sized knot of petrified wood and crystallised warp-matter from Wintersplinter's chest cavity. Can be used as a component in warding rituals (+10 to Willpower Tests to resist warp entities for 24 hours when worn) or traded to Madam Eva for a significant favour.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultist Salvage:</strong> 1d5 functional autoguns (Poor condition), assorted crude blades, 2d10 rounds of mixed ammunition, and scattered personal effects that provide minor lore about the Devotees' former lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quest Connections</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recaf Distillery:</strong> Sacred Seed #1 is critical for restoring the Distillery's anti-corruption properties. The Martikovs will be deeply grateful — permanently improving their disposition toward the Acolytes (+20 to all Fellowship Tests with Martikovs).</li>\n<li><strong>Three Sacred Seeds:</strong> Seed #1 is here, Seed #2 is at Berez (Baba Lysaga), Seed #3 is at Zarovich Spire. Recovering all three fully restores the Distillery.</li>\n<li><strong>Strahd's Reaction:</strong> Destroying the Tree visibly weakens warp-corruption across Barovus — the fog thins, the sky brightens marginally. Strahd becomes aware of the Acolytes as a genuine threat and escalates his attention accordingly. He is not angry; he is impressed. And that is worse.</li>\n<li><strong>Vision Quest Intelligence:</strong> The vision of Strahd's pact is one of the most important pieces of narrative intelligence in the campaign. It confirms the Slaanesh connection, the voluntary nature of the pact, and the scale of the price paid. This information is critical for the Empyrean Vault visit and the final confrontation.</li>\n<li><strong>Emperor's Tarot:</strong> If the Tarot reading designated Dawn's Edge as located at the Warp Nexus (The Pyre result), the relic power sword is embedded in the Tree's trunk and must be physically wrenched free (<em>Challenging (-10) Strength</em> Test while enduring 2d10 E damage per round from warp exposure).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strahd's Presence</h3>\n<p>Strahd does not appear at the Warp Nexus in person — the site is one of the few places on Barovus where his control is not absolute, as the xenos stones predate his pact and operate on principles he does not fully understand. However, his psychic echo permeates the Tree, and the Vision Quest is effectively a direct window into his past. He becomes aware of any Acolyte who experiences the vision and may comment on it during future encounters: <em>\"You saw the garden. You saw the mirror. Tell me — did you understand what you saw, or did you merely observe?\"</em></p>\n<p>If the Tree is destroyed, Strahd feels it as a physical pain — a momentary weakening of his connection to the land. He sends a servitor patrol (1d5+2 Elite Guards) to investigate within 2d10 hours. The Acolytes should be well clear by then.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Encounter Guide</h2>\n<p>The Warp Nexus is where the barrier between realspace and the immaterium is thinnest on Barovus. Xenos standing stones amplify warp energy into a concentrated upwelling; time flows strangely, colours shift, and shadows move independently. The Warp-Tree at the summit is a psychic echo of Strahd's homeworld, corrupted into a living conduit. Nature-Corruption Devotees worship here, guarding the tree and performing rituals. This is a high-corruption environment — extended exposure erodes sanity rapidly.</p>\n\n<h3>Standing Stones</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Skill Challenge</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The twelve standing stones radiate intense warp energy. <em>Psyniscience (Ordinary +10)</em> detects massive psychic resonance — xenos in origin, amplifying the immaterium. <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> each round spent among the stones or suffer 1 CP. The stones warp perception: distances are wrong, time stutters, and compasses read true but lead in circles.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> <em>Navigate (Hard -20)</em> to maintain orientation within the stone circle. Failure means circling back to the same stone (1d5 rounds lost). The space between stones is larger on the inside than the outside.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery (Lost Expedition Site 2 — Iron Psalm's Shore Party):</strong> A shattered landing shuttle lies half-buried near the outer stones. 4 Navy skeletons in a defensive circle — autoguns pointed outward, magazines empty. This is Sigma-7 expedition, approximately 200 years ago — a naval patrol group (connects to Handout 6, Transmission 1). <em>Tech-Use (Hard -20)</em> to recover a data-slate: partial survey data (+10 to Navigate in the Nexus area).</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Vox Recording — Shore Party, Entry 1:</em> \"Shore party Sigma-Seven-Three, reporting from the standing stones. Initial survey — the stones are basalt, roughly worked. Pre-Imperial, possibly xenos. No hostile contacts. The shuttle is two hundred metres east. We'll complete the survey and return within the hour. Emperor protects.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><em>Vox Recording — Shore Party, Entry 2 (timestamp: 4 hours later):</em> \"This is— we can't find the shuttle. We've been walking for four hours. The shuttle was two hundred metres away. Kowalski says we're going in circles but the compass reads true east every time. The stones are always ahead of us. They were behind us. Kowalski is— Kowalski? <strong>Kowalski?</strong> ...Where is Kowalski? There were four of us. There were four of us.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 2 CP per hour at the stones. 1d5 IP from the shore party remains — connecting names to Handout 6 transmissions makes the horror personal.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The shore party is the first physical evidence of Handout 6's transmissions. If players have read the handout, recognition hits hard. The Nexus warps space — use disorientation actively. Narrate contradictory directions, distances that don't add up, and the growing realisation that the stones are not merely markers but a cage.</p>\n\n<h3>The Warp-Tree</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Deadly</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Combat, Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> A massive tree infused with warp energy — twenty metres tall, trunk wider than a Leman Russ, made of wood and meat and something else. It pulses. It breathes. Proximity requires <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> — failure: 1d5 CP, success: 1 CP (unavoidable). Extended WP contest: 5 rounds, each round requires <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> to maintain sanity. The tree lashes out with root-tendrils (S 50, 1d10+8 I damage, Flexible) at anything within 5 metres.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> 8 Warp-Mutants (Warp-Mutant profile, Dangerous threat) guarding the tree — Nature-Corruption Devotees in ragged robes, chanting. Wintersplinter (tree-daemon, Deadly threat) activates if the tree is directly attacked. <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3, reduce mutants to 5. For 6+, add 3 mutants.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> Severing the tree's connection to the warp requires a ritual — <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Very Hard -30)</em> or <em>Scholastic Lore (Occult) (Very Hard -30)</em> to identify the method. Requires 3 rounds of sustained prayer (<em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> each round) while other characters defend. Alternatively, physical destruction: TB 12, 80 Wounds, immobile. Or an Extended Opposed Willpower Test (Tree WP 60, psyker must achieve 3 DoS before the Tree achieves 3).</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1d5+2 CP from proximity. 1d10 CP if tree is destroyed (massive warp backlash). 1d10 IP from visions during the WP contest.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is an extended set-piece, not a quick fight. The WP contest should feel like a siege on the Acolytes' sanity. Wintersplinter only activates if the tree is directly attacked — smart Acolytes may find the ritual alternative or the psyker contest. Sacred Seed #1 is embedded at the tree's base; recovering it requires destroying or severely damaging the tree. Destroying the tree visibly weakens warp-corruption across Barovus — the fog thins, the sky brightens, and Strahd takes notice.</p>\n\n<h3>Vision Quest</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Faith Test</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> At the Nexus centre, any psyker who touches a standing stone (or any Acolyte who touches the Tree) receives a vision: Strahd's original pact with the Daemon Prince of Slaanesh. They SEE him kneel before a mirror that does not reflect his face. They SEE the pact sealed, the garden die, the tree begin to bleed. They SEE Sergei's murder. They SEE Tatyana fall. The vision is vivid, immersive, and indistinguishable from reality for 1d5 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The vision reveals Strahd's one weakness: he cannot let Tatyana go. His obsession is the chain that binds him to the pact. It also confirms the nature of the pact (Slaanesh), the price (his humanity, his world, everything), and the moment of inception. <em>Willpower (Very Hard -30)</em> to retain full clarity of the vision; failure means fragmented, disordered memories.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1d10 CP (witnessing a daemonic pact firsthand — direct psychic connection to the moment). 2d10 IP (the full emotional weight of 300 years of tragedy compressed into minutes). Both halved on a successful <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> Test.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the single most CP-expensive voluntary encounter in the campaign. Players must choose: knowledge at enormous psychic cost. The vision should be narrated in full — read the pact scene aloud. The intelligence gained is invaluable but the price is staggering. Do not soften this. Let the players weigh the trade.</p>\n\n<h3>Wintersplinter's Lair</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Deadly</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Combat</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Wintersplinter — a warp-mutated tree-beast, the Nexus's guardian. Once human, now a three-metre monstrosity of bark-like skin, root-tendril limbs, and a face that is half-man, half-tree. Hulking size, S 55, T 60, 45 Wounds, Natural Armour 6, Regeneration 5/round while within 50m of the Warp-Tree. Unnatural Strength (x3), Fear (2). Commands nearby plant life to entangle — all Acolytes within 10m must pass <em>Agility (Challenging +0)</em> each round or become Immobilised until a Full Action cutting free. 4 Warp-Mutant attendants. <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3, reduce attendants to 2 and Wounds to 35. For 6+, add 2 attendants and increase Wounds to 55.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Fighting near the roots means unstable ground — <em>Agility (Challenging +0)</em> each round or fall prone. Warp-energy surges every 1d5 rounds: random target, <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or 1 CP.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 2 CP from combat proximity. 1d5 IP from witnessing Wintersplinter's form (tree-flesh hybrid, screaming faces in bark).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> If the Warp-Tree has been severed (ritual, destruction, or psyker contest), Wintersplinter loses Regeneration and is reduced to 30 Wounds. Smart parties handle the tree first. Brute-forcing Wintersplinter at full power is near-suicidal — 45 Wounds with Regeneration 5 and Natural Armour 6 while entangling the party is a grinding war of attrition. Reward creative tactics: fire, severing the roots, luring it away from the tree.</p>"

Moss and creeping vines have colonised its lower hull, and dark earth has been pushed up around its flanks by decades of erosion.

For off-world Acolytes who do not yet grasp the social dynamics of Barovus, it represents the single most significant supply cache available on the planet — lasgun charge packs, bolt pistol magazines, grenades, medical supplies, armour, and communications equipment.

He is <em>interested</em>. And that is far more dangerous than anger.</p>"

The Approach — Unstable Scree Slope</h3>\n<p>The crashed transport is located in the foothills between Fortress Vallak and the Warp Nexus, approximately one travel segment off the main road. Reaching it requires a <em>Challenging (+0) Navigate (Surface)</em> Test. The terrain is steep and unstable — loose scree, concealed sinkholes, and fog that clings to the hillside like gauze. Failure wastes 1d5 hours on false trails before finding the wreck.</p>\n<p><strong>Unstable Hillside:</strong> The slope surrounding the transport is treacherous. Approaching the cargo bay requires an <em>Ordinary (+10) Agility</em> Test. Failure means a minor slide: 1d5 Impact damage from tumbling scree, and the noise attracts attention — increase the number of warp-mutant scavengers in the encounter by +2. The scree provides poor footing: all movement on the slope counts as Difficult Terrain (half speed).</p>\n<p><strong>Warp-Flora Patches:</strong> Clumps of warp-corrupted vegetation dot the lower hillside — fleshy, bulbous growths with thorn-like protrusions that weep a bioluminescent ichor. Contact with the thorns requires a <em>Routine (+20) Toughness</em> Test or the Acolyte suffers 1d5 Toxic damage (ignoring armour) and a lingering numbness in the affected limb (-5 to tests using that limb for 1d10 rounds). The patches can be avoided with an <em>Ordinary (+10) Awareness</em> Test to spot them in the fog.</p>\n<h3>B. The Forward Cab</h3>\n<p>The Ridgehauler's forward cab is crushed from the impact, its armoured windscreen shattered and its control consoles buckled inward. The driver's remains are still strapped into the command throne — a skeleton in a rotted Munitorum transport uniform, one hand still gripping the steering yoke. A rosary of the Emperor hangs from the rearview mirror, its beads fused together by heat.</p>\n<p><strong>Salvageable Items:</strong> A <em>Challenging (+0) Search</em> Test recovers the following from the cab: a damaged but partially functional field vox-caster (range 5km, but broadcasts on a fixed frequency that Strahd's network monitors — the Acolytes will not know this without a <em>Hard (-20) Tech-Use</em> Test to diagnose), a personal data-slate belonging to the driver (contains a partial route map of the convoy's intended path and a final, panicked log entry describing the mutant ambush), and a laspistol with 2 charges remaining (Good condition).</p>\n<p><strong>The Driver's Log:</strong> The data-slate's final entry reads: <em>\"They came from the trees. Emperor preserve us. Kolya is dead. The road is gone. I am driving blind. If anyone finds this — the cargo is intact. Get it to Vallak. The garrison needs it. The garrison needs—\"</em> The entry ends abruptly. An <em>Ordinary (+10) Literacy</em> or <em>Common Lore (Imperial Guard)</em> Test confirms the convoy was an official Munitorum resupply run, lending legitimacy to claiming the cargo.</p>\n<h3>C. The Cargo Bay — The Prize</h3>\n<p>The rear cargo compartment is tilted at approximately thirty degrees but structurally sound. The exterior is scarred by claw marks and scorch damage from the original mutant attack, but the reinforced plasteel hull held. The cargo bay door is sealed with a standard Munitorum cipher-lock.</p>\n<p><strong>Opening the Lock:</strong> Requires a <em>Challenging (+0) Security</em> Test or a <em>Hard (-20) Strength</em> Test to force the corroded mechanism. An Acolyte with <em>Common Lore (Munitorum)</em> or <em>Common Lore (Imperial Guard)</em> recalls the standard emergency override codes, reducing the Security Test to <em>Routine (+20)</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Interior:</strong> Inside, crates are stacked and strapped to cargo rails, shifted by the angle but largely intact. Moisture-proof cases bear Munitorum stencils and Imperial Aquilas. The air inside is stale but dry — the seals held. Everything is covered in a fine layer of dust, undisturbed for decades.</p>\n<h3>Cargo Manifest</h3>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Quantity</th><th>Condition</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Lasgun Charge Packs</td><td>12</td><td>Good</td><td>Standard Imperial issue, sealed in moisture-proof cases</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Autogun Magazines (30-round)</td><td>8</td><td>Good</td><td>Wrapped in oiled cloth, still functional</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Bolt Pistol Magazines</td><td>2</td><td>Good</td><td>Rare and valuable; clearly intended for officer resupply</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Frag Grenades</td><td>6</td><td>Fair</td><td>Seals intact but corroded; 10% chance per grenade of delayed detonation (1 round late)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Krak Grenades</td><td>2</td><td>Good</td><td>Sealed in individual blast-proof cases</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Medikits</td><td>3</td><td>Fair</td><td>Drugs degraded; Medicae Tests using these suffer -10</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Ration Packs</td><td>20</td><td>Good</td><td>Sealed stasis-packaging; effectively fresh</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Flak Armour Sets</td><td>2</td><td>Good</td><td>Standard Imperial Guard issue, still serviceable</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Carapace Chest Plate</td><td>1</td><td>Good</td><td>Officer-grade; AP 6 to Body location</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Micro-bead Vox Units</td><td>4</td><td>Fair</td><td>Functional but range reduced to 500m due to age</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Magnoculars</td><td>1</td><td>Good</td><td>Standard issue with low-light enhancement</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Auspex (Hand-held)</td><td>1</td><td>Poor</td><td>Unreliable; -10 to Auspex Tests; intermittent in warp-heavy areas</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>D. The Surrounding Hillside</h3>\n<p>The hillside around the wreck is warp-mutant territory. Shallow caves in the scree serve as dens, littered with gnawed bones and scraps of corroded metal. A crude path through the rocks — barely visible — leads from the treeline to the transport's cargo bay, indicating the mutants have been circling the wreck for some time, unable to breach the Munitorum lock. Rock outcroppings at various elevations provide cover positions for both the Acolytes and their enemies. The upper map edge represents the fog ceiling — above this line, visibility drops to near zero.</p>"

They may already be attempting to breach the cargo bay, or they arrive drawn by noise shortly after the Acolytes open it. They are disorganised and desperate — starving creatures fighting over scraps. They attack on sight but break and flee if more than half their number are killed. One mutant, larger than the rest and bearing a crude lasgun with 1 charge remaining, serves as the pack alpha.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 — Hillside Collapse:</strong> The noise of combat triggers a partial landslide. At the <strong>end of Round 3</strong>, all combatants must pass a <em>Challenging (+0) Agility</em> Test or be knocked Prone and swept 1d10 metres downhill, taking 1d10+3 I damage from tumbling rocks and scree. The cargo bay door is partially buried by displaced earth — clearing it requires a <em>Challenging (+0) Strength</em> Test (+10 if two Acolytes work together). This is the moment of maximum tension: the Acolytes are mid-combat, the ground is shifting beneath them, and the prize is slipping away.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3 — Observation:</strong> As the Acolytes secure the cargo, a servitor-skull descends from the fog overhead. Unlike the dead one bolted to the door, this skull is very much active: its optics glow red, its anti-grav unit hums softly, and it hovers just out of easy reach, panning slowly across the scene. It records everything. It does not intervene. After approximately one minute, it rises back into the fog and flies north — toward the Zarovich Spire. The skull has <strong>Ag 50</strong> and <strong>TB 2, Wounds 6</strong> if the Acolytes attempt to shoot it down. Destroying it changes nothing — Strahd has dozens — but it may make the Acolytes feel better.</p>\n<h3>Corruption and Insanity</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warp-flora contact:</strong> 1d5 Toxic damage (ignoring armour) on failed <em>Routine (+20) Toughness</em></li>\n<li><strong>No significant Corruption or Insanity triggers at this location.</strong> The crashed transport is one of the rare \"clean\" sites on Barovus — no warp rituals, no daemonic presence, no psychic residue. This is intentional: the horror here is entirely mundane. Desperation, scarcity, and the knowledge that someone is always watching.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Loot and Items</h3>\n<p>See the Cargo Manifest table in Key Areas. This is a <strong>one-time supply cache</strong> — once claimed, it is gone. The GM should emphasise to the players that this is an exceptional find. Nothing else like it exists on Barovus. Additional minor salvage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forward cab:</strong> Damaged vox-caster (5km range, monitored frequency), laspistol (2 charges), driver's data-slate (partial route map, lore)</li>\n<li><strong>Mutant salvage:</strong> Crude weapons (negligible value), 1d5 ration packs (partially consumed, unappetising but edible), assorted scrap metal</li>\n<li><strong>Vehicle components:</strong> An Acolyte with <em>Trade (Armourer)</em> or <em>Tech-Use</em> can strip useful components — fuel cells (enough for a small generator or to recharge 2d10 lasgun packs), replacement armour plates, wire and cable (useful for field repairs and traps)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quest Connections</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Resupply:</strong> The cargo manifest represents the single largest equipment boost available in the campaign. Smart distribution of these supplies among the party is a tactical decision worth spending real time on.</li>\n<li><strong>Strahd's Interest:</strong> Strahd now knows the Acolytes have armed themselves from his claimed stockpile. He is not angry — the supplies are meaningless to him. He is <em>interested</em>. He may reference this during a future encounter: <em>\"I see you helped yourselves to my property. I do not mind. A well-equipped adversary is far more entertaining than a desperate one.\"</em></li>\n<li><strong>Fortress Vallak:</strong> The driver's data-slate and the cargo's Munitorum markings provide evidence that the Lord-Governor has been hoarding or neglecting Imperial supply lines — useful leverage in political dealings with Burgomaster Vallakovich or Lady Wachter.</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing Surveillance:</strong> The servitor-skull observation establishes a pattern. From this point forward, the Acolytes should assume Strahd knows their approximate location and equipment status at all times. Paranoia is appropriate and should be encouraged.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strahd's Presence</h3>\n<p>Strahd does not appear in person at the crash site. His presence is felt through the dead servitor-skull's territorial claim and the live servitor-skull's silent observation. The encounter is designed to make the Acolytes understand two things simultaneously: first, that Barovus is a world of scarcity where every bullet matters; and second, that Strahd's dominion extends even to abandoned wrecks on remote hillsides. Everything on Barovus belongs to him. The Acolytes are taking what is his. He allows it — because it serves his entertainment.</p>\n<p>If the Acolytes have already drawn significant attention (destroyed the Warp-Tree, killed Strahd's forces in Fortress Vallak, etc.), the servitor-skull may carry a recorded message in Strahd's voice: <em>\"You continue to impress. Please — take what you need. I insist. The hunt is more satisfying when the quarry believes it has a chance.\"</em> This message inflicts 1 Insanity Point (no save) from the casual, absolute certainty of a predator who has never been prey.</p>"

Part of an early resupply convoy ambushed by warp-mutants decades ago, it represents the single largest supply cache on Barovus outside Fortress Vallak. The locals avoid it because Strahd's servitor-skulls have marked it as his property.

The transport is wedged into the hillside at approximately 30 degrees. Weather exposure — <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> or 1 Fatigue from cold and wind. Fog clings to the hillside, limiting visibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> <em>Navigate (Challenging +0)</em> to find the optimal approach route.

The noise of a rockslide attracts attention: +2 Warp-Mutant Scavengers added to the Cargo Bay encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The approach is a natural filter. Impatient parties take damage and alert the mutants; careful ones arrive unscathed. The transport is visible from the road — it is not hidden, just hard to reach.

Just an accident. Sometimes things are just tragic.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The cab is quiet, almost mundane. After so much horror, a normal death is jarring. Let that land. The driver died doing their duty — a Munitorum hauler on a supply run, killed by physics, not the warp. There is no twist here.

This is the single largest supply cache in the campaign outside Fortress Vallak.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is a major resupply opportunity. The combat is the price of admission. The tilted environment should make the fight memorable — crates sliding, footing uncertain, the alpha mutant scrambling along the ceiling beams.

Phase 1 gives fair warning — attentive players have time to grab what they can and run. The landslide buries the transport permanently; any cargo not already removed is lost. Creates urgency: grab what you can and go. Strahd's reaction is not anger — it is interest. He may reference this later: \"I see you helped yourselves to my property. I do not mind. A well-equipped adversary is far more entertaining than a desperate one.\"</p>"

It is operated by an extended branch of the Martikov family, the same warp-touched shapeshifters who run the Blue Water Inn in Fortress Vallak. When the Acolytes arrive, the distillery is under active assault by warp-corrupted flora — ambulatory vine-creatures animated by the same energy that feeds the Warp-Tree at the Nexus — and a raiding party of Nature-Corruption Devotees sent to ensure the distillery's destruction.</p>\n<p>This location is the keystone of the campaign's supply and alliance systems. Liberating the distillery accomplishes three things simultaneously: it secures a reliable source of food, recaf, and medicinal herbs for the Acolytes and their allies; it launches the Three Sacred Seeds quest chain that spans three other major locations; and it forces the Acolytes to confront the Martikovs' secret — that their most valuable allies on Barovus are warp-touched mutants whose existence violates every tenet of Imperial doctrine. The moral dilemma is deliberate and has no clean resolution.</p>\n<p>The distillery's unique properties — its crops grow despite the warp-corruption, its recaf has mild anti-corruption effects — derive from three sacred seeds blessed by a Ministorum saint centuries ago and planted in the distillery's soil. All three have been stolen, and the distillery is dying. Without at least one seed, the crops will fail within weeks and the last reliable food source on Barovus will be gone.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas</h2>\n<h3>A. Perimeter Defences — Barricades and Watchtowers</h3>\n<p>The distillery complex is surrounded by a low stone wall — waist-height, originally designed to mark property boundaries rather than repel assault. The Martikovs have reinforced it with makeshift barricades: overturned carts, stacked barrels, sheets of corrugated plasteel scavenged from nearby ruins. Two crude watchtowers — little more than raised platforms with sandbag walls — stand at the eastern and western corners, each equipped with a mounted stubber (5 rounds remaining in each).</p>\n<p><strong>Breach Points:</strong> When the Acolytes arrive, the eastern barricade has been breached. Corrupted Plant-Forms are pouring through the gap, their root-limbs tearing at the stonework. The western barricade still holds but is under pressure — 1d5 Devotees are attempting to set it alight with crude incendiaries. An Acolyte who reaches the eastern breach can reinforce it with a <em>Challenging (+0) Strength</em> Test (pushing debris back into the gap) or by destroying the Plant-Forms in the breach zone.</p>\n<p><strong>The Watchtowers:</strong> Each tower is occupied by a Martikov family member with an autogun. The eastern tower's occupant is wounded and pinned down by Devotee fire. The western tower's occupant — <strong>Adrian Martikov</strong>, Davian's grandson — is holding his position but running low on ammunition. Reaching either tower requires crossing open ground under fire (<em>Challenging (+0) Agility</em> Test to avoid 1d10+3 I damage from Devotee autogun fire).</p>\n<h3>B. Main Distillery Floor — Processing Hall</h3>\n<p>The heart of the complex: a long, high-ceilinged stone hall filled with copper stills, fermentation vats, piping networks, and the heavy, aromatic scent of recaf processing. The machinery is old — three centuries old, in fact — but lovingly maintained by generations of Martikovs. Several vats are ruptured, their contents pooling on the flagstone floor in dark, steaming puddles. A Corrupted Plant-Form has infiltrated through a broken window and is growing into the machinery, its root tendrils wrapping around pipes and threatening to destroy the processing equipment.</p>\n<p><strong>The Processing Equipment:</strong> If the Plant-Form is not cleared from the machinery within 10 rounds of the Acolytes entering, it fuses permanently with the stills, rendering them inoperable. Clearing the Plant-Form from the machinery without damaging the equipment requires either careful melee work (<em>Challenging (+0) WS</em> with a called shot, or any attack that deals fire damage — the Plant-Form is <strong>Vulnerable to Fire</strong>, taking double damage) or a <em>Hard (-20) Tech-Use</em> Test to activate the emergency steam venting, which scalds the Plant-Form for 2d10 E damage but also risks damaging the pipes (10% chance).</p>\n<p><strong>Fermentation Vats:</strong> The large copper vats provide Heavy Cover (+8 AP to one location) but are pressurised — a stray shot that penetrates a vat causes it to rupture, spraying scalding liquid in a 3-metre radius (1d10 E damage, Ag Test to dodge). There are 6 intact vats; each can only rupture once.</p>\n<h3>C. Storage Cellars — Barrels and Hidden Passage</h3>\n<p>Below the main floor, accessed by a stone stairway, the cellars extend beneath the entire complex. Rows of recaf barrels line the walls — most are empty, a testament to how depleted the distillery's reserves have become. The air is cool, damp, and tinged with the earthy smell of aged recaf. Warp-flora has not penetrated here yet, making the cellars a relatively safe refuge for wounded Martikovs and non-combatants.</p>\n<p><strong>The Seed Vault:</strong> Behind a false wall at the cellar's deepest point lies a small chamber — the original planting room where the three sacred seeds were blessed and sown. The soil beds are empty, their sanctified earth grey and lifeless without the seeds. A faded Ministorum prayer scroll on the wall identifies the chamber's purpose: <em>\"By the Emperor's Grace, these seeds shall nourish the faithful and deny sustenance to the corrupt.\"</em> Replanting a recovered seed here requires pressing it into the soil and reciting any Imperial prayer or litany — the seed does the rest, glowing golden as it takes root.</p>\n<p><strong>Hidden Passage:</strong> A narrow tunnel behind the seed vault leads to an exit point fifty metres outside the perimeter wall. The Martikovs use this as an escape route. An <em>Ordinary (+10) Search</em> Test reveals the tunnel if the Acolytes explore the cellars; the Martikovs will reveal it voluntarily if they trust the Acolytes.</p>\n<h3>D. Martikov Family Quarters — Upper Floor</h3>\n<p>The upper floor of the main building serves as living quarters for the extended Martikov family. Modest but clean rooms with hand-sewn furnishings, shelves of salvaged books, children's drawings pinned to walls, and a communal dining area. It is conspicuously normal — a reminder that people live here, raise families here, and are fighting to protect something that matters to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Davian's Study:</strong> The patriarch's private room contains a locked desk (<em>Ordinary (+10) Security</em> to pick, or Davian provides the key if trusted). Inside: a hand-drawn map of Barovus with Martikov raven-surveillance routes marked, a journal documenting Strahd's troop movements over the past decade, and a sealed letter addressed to <em>\"whoever comes after us\"</em> — a contingency confession of the family's shapeshifter nature, written in case they are killed, asking that whoever reads it understand they only ever wanted to protect the people of Barovus.</p>\n<p><strong>The Martikovs' Secret:</strong> During the battle to liberate the distillery, the Martikovs shift between human and raven form without thinking to hide it — diving from upper windows as ravens to scout enemy positions, shifting back to human form to relay information, carrying messages between watchtowers in avian form. If the Acolytes have not already learned the family's nature at the Blue Water Inn, this is the moment of revelation. The moral dilemma is immediate: these mutants are risking their lives to defend humanity. Doctrine demands their destruction. Pragmatism — and perhaps conscience — demands their preservation.</p>"

Davian has seen outsiders before — Strahd has sent agents disguised as travelers. He will cooperate with the Acolytes during the siege out of necessity, but full trust requires completing the liberation and demonstrating genuine commitment to opposing the Lord-Governor.</p>\n<p><strong>What He Knows:</strong> The location of all three sacred seeds (one at the Warp Nexus, one with Baba Lysaga in Berez, one at the Zarovich Spire). Strahd's recent troop movements and patrol patterns. Van Richten's identity and location in Fortress Vallak. The political dynamics of every surviving settlement. He shares this intelligence incrementally, releasing more valuable information as trust increases.</p>\n<p><strong>What He Wants:</strong> The sacred seeds returned. The distillery secured. His family safe. In that order.</p>\n<h3>Adrian Martikov — Grandson, Scout</h3>\n<p>Young, reckless, and fiercely loyal to the family. Adrian is the distillery's best scout — fastest in raven form, sharpest eyes, and a talent for getting into places he should not be. He is manning the western watchtower when the Acolytes arrive and will be the first Martikov to interact with them during the siege.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Eager. Adrian wants to fight Strahd. He sees the Acolytes as the warriors the family has been waiting for and may overshare information in his enthusiasm, earning a sharp rebuke from Davian.</p>\n<h3>Martikov Combat Profile (Human Form)</h3>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>WS</th><th>BS</th><th>S</th><th>T</th><th>Ag</th><th>Int</th><th>Per</th><th>WP</th><th>Fel</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody><tr><td>Value</td><td>30</td><td>35</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>45</td><td>40</td><td>50</td><td>40</td><td>35</td></tr></tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Wounds:</strong> 12 | <strong>Armour:</strong> Improvised flak (AP 2 body) | <strong>Weapons:</strong> Autogun, knife</p>\n<p><strong>Shapeshifter:</strong> As a Half Action, a Martikov can shift to raven form (Flyer 8, Size Puny, cannot attack, +30 Stealth, +20 Awareness) or back to human form. The shift is instantaneous and painless. Equipment does not transform — it falls where they stand.</p>\n<h3>Besieging Forces</h3>\n<h3>Corrupted Plant-Forms</h3>\n<p><strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Challenging (per swarm)</p>\n<p>Ambulatory masses of warp-corrupted vegetation — writhing tangles of thorned vines, pulsing root-tendrils, and bulbous fruiting bodies that burst to release clouds of toxic spores. They are not intelligent, but they are relentless, drawn to the distillery's sacred soil like parasites to a host.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile (Swarm):</strong> TB 3, Wounds 30 per swarm. Immune to single-target ranged weapons (use Blast, Spray, or melee area attacks). <strong>Vulnerable to Fire</strong> — fire damage is doubled. Each swarm occupies a 5m x 5m area and attacks all creatures within it: 1d10+3 R damage, Toxic (failed <em>Toughness</em> Test = additional 1d5 damage ignoring armour). Swarms move at half speed and cannot climb.</p>\n<p><strong>Number:</strong> 2d10 individual Plant-Forms, treated as 2-4 swarm groups depending on party strength.</p>\n<h3>Nature-Corruption Devotees (Raiding Party)</h3>\n<p><strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Ordinary (individually); Challenging (as a group)</p>\n<p><strong>Number:</strong> 1d5+3</p>\n<p>A raiding party from the Warp Nexus, sent to ensure the distillery's destruction. They are better armed and more organised than the Plant-Forms — they carry autoguns, crude incendiaries (treat as fire bombs: 1d10+4 E, Blast 2, sets targets alight), and fight with the desperate conviction of true believers. Their leader, a scarred woman with bark growing from her scalp, coordinates the assault from the treeline with hand signals.</p>\n<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Use Cultist profiles with minor random mutations, +5 WP, and <em>Resistance (Fear)</em>.</p>\n<h3>Liberation Encounter</h3>\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Clear the distillery of all hostile forces. This is a multi-front battle — the Acolytes must manage the eastern breach, the western barricade, the Plant-Form infiltration of the processing floor, and the Devotee fire from the treeline simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>Victory Conditions:</strong> The siege breaks when all Plant-Form swarms are destroyed and the Devotee raiding party is killed or routed. Devotees flee if their leader is killed or if they take 50% casualties. Plant-Forms continue mindlessly until destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactical Notes:</strong> Fire is the Acolytes' best weapon against the Plant-Forms. The fermentation vats contain alcohol-rich liquid that can be used as improvised incendiaries (<em>Ordinary (+10) Intelligence</em> to think of this; <em>Challenging (+0) Agility</em> to deploy without self-immolation). The Martikovs in raven form provide real-time intelligence on enemy positions — the GM should relay enemy movements to the players each round as the ravens report back. The hidden tunnel in the cellars can be used for flanking manoeuvres.</p>"

NPCs in supplied settlements become more cooperative (+10 to all Fellowship-based Tests). The Acolytes can requisition basic supplies — ration packs, medikit refills, low-grade ammunition — without cost.</li>\n<li><strong>The Warp Nexus:</strong> The Devotees besieging the distillery are from the Nexus. Liberating the distillery reveals the connection and provides motivation to assault the Nexus and recover Seed #1.</li>\n<li><strong>Berez:</strong> Davian can provide intelligence on Baba Lysaga's lair and the location of Seed #2, including warnings about the walking hab-unit and the swamp's hazards.</li>\n<li><strong>Blue Water Inn:</strong> The Martikovs at the distillery and the Blue Water Inn are the same family.

However, the Devotee raiding party was dispatched at his indirect behest. He tolerates the Nature-Corruption cult because their worship of the warp strengthens his domain, and he occasionally directs their aggression toward targets he wants destroyed without dirtying his own hands.</p>\n<p>If the Acolytes liberate the distillery, Strahd takes note but does not retaliate immediately. He has patience measured in centuries. He may send a congratulatory message via servitor-skull: <em>\"How industrious. You have saved a recaf distillery. I confess I am almost moved. The Martikovs are useful creatures, are they not? Such loyalty. Such devotion. One almost forgets what they are.\"</em> The implication is clear — he knows the Martikovs are mutants, and he is reminding the Acolytes that he could reveal this to the settlements at any time, destroying the trust the family has built over generations. This threat should hang over the Acolytes for the remainder of the campaign.</p>"

A complex of stone buildings and fermentation towers on a hillside of dead vineyards, it produces the only reliable food and recaf on the planet. The Martikov family operates it — warp-touched shapeshifters (human/raven) who use their mutation in service to humanity. When the Acolytes arrive, the distillery is under active siege. Its unique properties derive from three sacred seeds blessed by a Ministorum saint centuries ago; two have been stolen, and the third is fading.</p>\n\n<h3>Approach and Siege</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Combat, Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The distillery is under active assault. Smoke and flames rise from the eastern wing, broken barriers litter the approach, and the sounds of las-fire and rhythmic chanting carry across the hillside. The dead vineyards provide limited cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> 6 Druzhina Raiders (Chaos Cultist profile, Challenging threat) + 4 Blighted Creepers (warp-flora, use Warp-Mutant profile with -10 WS but +Toxic trait — ambulatory vine-creatures animated by the same energy that feeds the Warp-Tree). <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3, reduce to 4 raiders + 2 creepers. For 6+, add 2 raiders + 2 creepers.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> <em>Command (Challenging +0)</em> to coordinate with the defending Martikovs. <em>Tactics (Ordinary +10)</em> to identify weak points in the siege — the raiders have concentrated on the eastern wing, leaving the southern approach lightly guarded.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP from proximity to warp-flora. The Blighted Creepers exude a sickly-sweet scent that induces nausea.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is a dynamic battlefield — the siege is ongoing when the Acolytes arrive. They can intervene directly, observe from a distance, or attempt to sneak in via the unguarded south. The Martikovs are fighting but losing. During combat, the Martikovs shift between human and raven form without thinking to hide it — this reveals their secret if the Acolytes have not already learned it. The moral question lands immediately: mutants fighting for humanity.</p>\n\n<h3>Distillery Interior</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Skill Challenge, Social</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Adrian Martikov and family. They are wereravens — warp-touched shapeshifters, human and raven forms. Their secret is difficult to detect: <em>Awareness (Very Hard -30)</em> if not already revealed during the siege. They are loyal to the Emperor in their own way. <em>Charm (Ordinary +10)</em> for alliance — they provide safe rest, information, and ongoing recaf supply. They can share intelligence on Fortress Vallak's political dynamics, Van Richten's location, and Strahd's recent movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> <em>Tech-Use (Challenging +0)</em> to repair damaged distillery equipment (the siege caused significant damage). <em>Trade (Chymist) (Ordinary +10)</em> to improve recaf production. Successful repairs improve morale and output.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The Martikovs know the location of the three Sacred Seeds that power the distillery. Without them, the recaf — Barovus's only reliable crop — dies. Seed #1 is at the Warp Nexus (embedded in the Warp-Tree). Seed #2 is at Berez (Baba Lysaga took it). Seed #3 is at the Zarovich Spire (Strahd's private collection — casual cruelty).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The Martikovs are crucial long-term allies. Their secret creates a moral dilemma: mutation in service of the Emperor. Imperial doctrine demands their destruction. Pragmatism — and arguably the Emperor's will — demands their preservation. Do not resolve this tension for the players. Let it sit.</p>\n\n<h3>Sacred Seed Vaults</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Investigation, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> The vaults originally held 3 seeds — only 1 remains. <em>Inquiry (Challenging +0)</em> with the Martikovs reveals the fate of each stolen seed and begins the three-location recovery chain (Warp Nexus, Berez, Zarovich Spire).</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The remaining seed radiates faint warp energy — but good warp energy. <em>Psyniscience (Ordinary +10)</em>: it is a pre-Imperial xenos artifact, attuned to growth and life. <em>Forbidden Lore (Xenos) (Hard -20)</em>: possibly Aeldari in origin. The seed's power is why the distillery's crops grow despite the warp-corruption and why the recaf has mild anti-corruption effects (+5 to next Corruption Test after consumption).</p>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> Praying over the seed — <em>Willpower (Ordinary +10)</em>: brief vision of green fields, warm sunlight, the scent of living things. Reduces 1d5 IP. The Emperor's light works through strange vessels.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The seed quest is a three-location chain. Recovering all three seeds restores the distillery fully and provides a permanent safe haven plus supply line: NPCs in supplied settlements gain +10 to Fellowship-based Tests, and the Acolytes can requisition basic supplies without cost. Each seed location (here, Berez, Nexus) has its own challenges. This is one of the campaign's most rewarding long-term quest lines.</p>\n\n<h3>Hydroponic Gardens</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Social</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Martikov family members tend the gardens. Children play among the grow-beds. It is almost normal. <em>Awareness (Ordinary +10)</em> — the gardens are warded against warp influence by the remaining seed's power. The air is clean. The light seems warmer. This is what Barovus could be.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Botanical samples — <em>Medicae (Challenging +0)</em> or <em>Trade (Apothecary) (Ordinary +10)</em> to identify medicinal plants. 1d5 doses of healing herbs (equivalent to one medikit each). Belladonna grows here — anti-warp poultice, +10 vs Corruption for 1 hour per application.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> A respite location. Let the players rest, heal, and be reminded of what they are fighting for. The Martikovs represent the best of humanity under impossible conditions — people who endure, who grow things, who raise children in a warp-blighted nightmare and refuse to stop living. After the horrors of the Nexus and the road, this place should feel like a blessing. That is the point.</p>"

The water glows at night — a sickly phosphorescent green that illuminates the underside of the fog and casts shadows that move against the light. Things wade through the shallows: bloated grey shapes with empty eyes and mouths open in silent screams. And somewhere deeper in, something massive is moving. You hear the groan of stressed metal, the squelch of enormous footfalls in deep mud, and a voice — old, cracked, singing a lullaby in a language you do not know but somehow understand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Key Fact</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Act</strong></td><td>Act II — The Domain of Dread</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Map Ref</strong></td><td>Map 9 (40×35 swamp/ruin grid)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Population / Status</strong></td><td>None living.

Approximately two centuries ago, a woman named Marina was born here, a previous reincarnation of Tatyana. When the villagers recognised her resemblance to the figure Strahd coveted and killed her in a desperate attempt to avoid his attention, the Lord-Governor’s fury manifested as a catastrophic psychic event that diverted a river, flooded the settlement, and slaughtered every living thing within it. The dead did not stay dead. They still wade through the black water, mindless and hungry, and the swamp itself has become saturated with warp energy so thick it is almost tangible.</p>\n\n<p>The sole inhabitant of note is <strong>Baba Lysaga</strong>, the Warp-Hag — a being of impossible antiquity who claims to be Strahd’s spiritual mother. She dwells in a walking hab-unit that lurches through the swamp on massive mechanical legs, and she guards her domain with psychic powers of terrifying potency. Lysaga possesses the second sacred seed stolen from the Recaf Distillery, using its residual sanctity as fuel for her warp-rituals. She will not part with it willingly. She will not part with anything willingly. She considers every aspect of Strahd’s existence her personal charge, and she will destroy anyone she perceives as a threat to “her baby” with maternal ferocity that borders on the apocalyptic.</p>\n\n<p>For the Game Master, Berez serves a dual narrative purpose. First, it is a high-danger combat location — Lysaga is one of the most dangerous non-Strahd enemies in the campaign, and arriving unprepared is a near-certain party kill. Second, the Marina monument at the centre of the ruins contains a critical lore revelation: the full cycle of Tatyana’s reincarnations across centuries, each life ending in tragedy orchestrated by Strahd’s obsession. If Ireena is present when this monument is discovered, the psychic resonance it triggers will change the trajectory of the entire campaign. The Acolytes should leave Berez waterlogged, battered, and haunted — but armed with knowledge that Strahd’s curse is far older and far more terrible than they imagined.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas</h2>\n\n<h3>A1. The Approach — Swamp Roads</h3>\n<p><strong>The road from Fortress Vallak deteriorates over two travel segments into a waterlogged track barely distinguishable from the surrounding marshland.</strong> The last half-segment has no road at all — only mudflats, stagnant pools, and dense banks of fog that reduce visibility to 15 metres. The air stinks of organic decay and something sweeter underneath: the cloying, chemical scent of warp-saturation.</p>\n<p>Movement through the swamp is at <strong>half speed</strong>. All <strong>Agility-based Tests suffer −10</strong> due to sucking mud, hidden sinkholes, and submerged debris. The water ranges from ankle-deep to waist-deep depending on the path chosen, and deeper channels exist that can swallow a fully armoured Acolyte without warning (<strong>Challenging (+0) Awareness</strong> Test to spot before stepping in; <strong>Challenging (+0) Strength</strong> Test to pull free if submerged). Plague revenants are encountered at a rate of <strong>1d5 every 30 minutes</strong> of exploration — they rise from the water with little warning, and the terrain makes fighting them significantly more dangerous than on solid ground.</p>\n\n<h3>A2. The Ruined Settlement</h3>\n<p><strong>The remains of Berez proper emerge from the waterline like the ribcage of a drowned giant.</strong> Walls of prefabricated Imperial hab-blocks jut from the black water at angles that speak of catastrophic subsidence. Rooftops that were once ground-level now serve as the only dry ground. Interior spaces are flooded, their contents reduced to sludge and corrosion, though occasionally a scavenging party can recover small items — a corroded data-slate, a waterlogged prayer book, a child’s toy fused with rust.</p>\n<p>Navigation through the ruins requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Navigate (Surface)</strong> or <strong>Survival</strong> Test to maintain direction. The ruins are disorienting: identical hab-block shells repeat in rows, the water reflects the perpetual grey sky so that up and down become uncertain, and the warp-glow beneath the surface creates the impression of structures continuing beneath the waterline — structures that were never there. Acolytes who fail navigation tests by three or more degrees find themselves circling back to their starting point, having lost 1d5 hours.</p>\n\n<h3>A3. Marina’s Monument</h3>\n<p><strong>Near the centre of old Berez, on a raised platform of cracked rockcrete that still sits above the waterline, stands a stone marker approximately two metres tall.</strong> It is weathered but legible: a carved relief of a young woman’s face surrounded by Imperial aquilas and devotional script. The inscription reads, in faded High Gothic: <em>“For Marina, who was loved too well by the wrong power. The Emperor protect her soul, for no one else could.”</em></p>\n<p>The monument radiates a faint psychic resonance detectable by any psyker or any Acolyte who passes a <strong>Difficult (−10) Psyniscience</strong> Test. If <strong>Ireena Kolyana is present</strong>, the monument triggers a full psychic vision: Ireena (and all Acolytes within 5 metres) experiences a cascade of images and sensations — dozens of lives, each a woman with Tatyana’s face, each born on Barovus across the centuries, each found by Strahd, each ending in tragedy. Marina drowned. Another fell from the Spire. Another was burned as a witch. Another simply vanished. The vision lasts approximately one minute of real time but feels like hours. All who experience it gain <strong>1d5 Insanity Points</strong> but also gain the knowledge that Strahd’s obsession is a cycle — Tatyana’s soul is reincarnated again and again, and Strahd has never once succeeded in claiming her. This information is critical for several of the Ireena endgame resolutions in Act IV.</p>\n\n<h3>A4. Baba Lysaga’s Walking Hab-Unit</h3>\n<p><strong>The walking hab-unit is impossible to miss once encountered: a standard-pattern Imperial prefabricated dwelling module, approximately 8 metres long and 4 metres wide, mounted on four massive mechanical legs of uncertain origin.</strong> The legs are a fusion of industrial walker components, salvaged servitor limbs, and something organic — they flex and grip with an unsettling fluidity that no purely mechanical system should possess. The hab-unit’s exterior is festooned with fetishes: bones, defiled holy symbols, strips of flayed skin inscribed with warp-runes, and dozens of crude dolls made from mud and hair that Lysaga insists are “my baby’s toys.”</p>\n<p>The hab-unit moves through the deepest parts of the swamp, its legs keeping the structure above the waterline. Lysaga occupies the upper compartment, which she has converted into a nauseating combination of living quarters, ritual chamber, and trophy room. The sacred seed from the Recaf Distillery is kept here, along with any Tarot-designated artifacts the GM has placed in Berez. A skull-mounted sentry gun is bolted to the hab-unit’s roof — a salvaged heavy stubber on an automated gimbal that Lysaga can direct with a thought (<strong>BS 35, 1d10+4 I, Pen 3, Full Auto, 60m range</strong>).</p>\n<p>The interior stinks of spoiled food, rendered fat, and warp-ozone. Every surface is covered in wax, dried blood, and incomprehensible scrawl. Among the refuse, Acolytes who search carefully (<strong>Hard (−20) Search</strong> Test) can find fragments of genuine intelligence: old data-slates with records of Strahd’s early rule, handwritten observations of his behaviour spanning centuries, and — disturbingly — detailed notes on the Tatyana reincarnation cycle that suggest Lysaga has been tracking and, in some cases, manipulating it.</p>\n\n<h3>A5. The Dock Ruins</h3>\n<p><strong>At the settlement’s eastern edge, the remnants of a small river dock project from the water.</strong> Before the flooding, Berez relied on river trade. Now the dock pilings are encrusted with something that is not quite fungus and not quite coral — a bioluminescent growth that pulses faintly in the green-lit darkness. A single flat-bottomed boat, miraculously intact, is tied to one of the pilings. It can carry up to four Acolytes and provides faster transit through the flooded ruins than wading (<strong>Ordinary (+10) Navigate (Surface)</strong> to handle it), but using it makes the party conspicuous and draws plague revenants from a wider radius.</p>"

Her skin ripples and shifts as though something beneath it is trying to get out. Her fingers are too long. Her smile is too wide. Her eyes are solid black, depthless pools that reflect nothing. She was present at Strahd’s birth, served as his nursemaid, and claims with absolute conviction — and homicidal ferocity toward any who dispute it — that she is his true mother.</p>\n<p>She made pacts with warp-entities before Strahd was born, shaping events across decades to ensure his rise to power. In her mind, everything she has done — every murder, every corruption, every abomination — has been an act of maternal love. This makes her not merely dangerous but <em>tragic</em>, in the way that only 40k villainy can be: a being whose devotion is genuine, absolute, and utterly insane.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Social Interaction:</strong> Lysaga will speak with the Acolytes briefly before attacking, but <em>only</em> if they do not mention Strahd in a threatening context. She responds well to flattery about her “son” and may provide information about Barovus’s history if the Acolytes pretend to admire Strahd’s rule (<strong>Very Hard (−30) Deceive</strong> Test). Any mention of harming, opposing, or “freeing” Strahd triggers immediate, berserk hostility. There is no diplomacy path that avoids combat if the Acolytes’ mission is known.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Psychic Powers:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Power</th><th>Action</th><th>Effect</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Warp Fire</strong></td><td>Half</td><td>20m cone, 3d10+7 E damage, Pen 4, Flame quality.

She can only be targeted separately via a <strong>called shot at −20</strong> through the observation slit. The hab-unit attacks independently with <strong>Stomping Legs</strong> (2d10+10 I, Pen 5, Concussive [2]) and <strong>Warp-Animated Tendrils</strong> (1d10+8 R, Snare: Strength test at −10 or Grappled; 1d10+8 R automatic damage per round while grappled).</p>\n<p>The hab-unit is <strong>warp-animated</strong> — it has no machine spirit and is immune to Tech-Use and haywire effects. It <em>is</em> vulnerable to holy/blessed weapons, which ignore 10 points of its Armour. If reduced to 0 SI, it collapses. Lysaga must pass an Agility test or take 2d10 I damage, then fights on foot. <strong>Destroying the vehicle first is the recommended tactical approach.</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Plague Revenants</h3>\n<p><strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Ordinary (dangerous in groups of 6+) | <strong>Wounds:</strong> 15 | <strong>AP:</strong> 2</p>\n<p>The swamp is <em>full</em> of them. Bloated, grey, leaking dark fluid, they rise from the water at a rate of 1d5 every 30 minutes. In combat with Lysaga, she can Animate Dead to summon 1d5 more per round. They attack with toxic fists/teeth (1d10+3 R, Toxic — Toughness test or 1d10 additional damage ignoring armour). They are Mindless, Shambling (act last in initiative, cannot Run), and Undying (on Critical Damage, roll 1d10: on 1–5 they ignore it; permanently destroyed only by fire, blessed weapons, or head destruction).</p>\n<p>The miasma released when they are destroyed forces all within 3 metres to pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Toughness</strong> Test or suffer 1d10 Toxic damage ignoring armour. In the close confines of the swamp, this creates a cascading hazard during large-scale engagements.</p>\n\n<h3>Combat Encounter: Lysaga’s Last Stand</h3>\n<p>This is a <strong>major boss encounter</strong> and should be treated as such. Lysaga fights from within her walking hab-unit, deploying psychic powers while the vehicle itself engages in melee. She is accompanied by <strong>2d10 plague revenants</strong> at combat start, with reinforcements arriving via Animate Dead. Her warp-crow swarm provides additional area denial.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain advantages favour Lysaga:</strong> deep water restricts Acolyte movement, unstable ground prevents stable firing positions, and limited cover means ranged attackers are exposed to her Warp Fire and Death’s Embrace. The Acolytes should be advised (through Van Richten, Vostra contacts, or their own reconnaissance) that Berez is a <strong>lethal location</strong> requiring preparation. Arriving without anti-armour weapons, blessed ammunition, or a solid tactical plan is a likely TPK.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactical Notes for the GM:</strong> Lysaga’s primary weakness is her emotional instability. She is insane, and her insanity can be exploited. Taunts about Strahd not loving her, claims that the Acolytes have Strahd’s blessing, or presenting a convincing forgery of a letter from Strahd (<strong>Very Hard (−30) Deceive</strong>) can cause her to hesitate for 1 round (stunned, processing emotional distress) or redirect her attacks toward the source of the emotional threat rather than the most tactically appropriate target. This is not a reliable strategy, but it can buy precious time.</p>"

He considers her a useful tool and an amusing relic, but he does not love her — a fact that would shatter her if she ever learned it. If the Acolytes are about to deliver the killing blow, there is a <strong>25% chance</strong> Strahd intervenes via psychic projection: his voice echoes across the swamp, thanking the Acolytes for “pruning the old growth” and expressing mild regret that “Mother” could not adapt to the times. This intervention does not save Lysaga — it merely demonstrates Strahd’s casual cruelty and his willingness to discard even his most devoted servants. If Lysaga hears this, she suffers a psychic breakdown: stunned for 2 rounds, weeping, before fighting with renewed and utterly desperate fury (+10 to all combat tests, −20 to all defensive tests).</p>\n<p>Strahd monitors the Acolytes’ progress through Berez via warp-crows and plague revenants serving as passive sensors. He is aware of their arrival within 1d5 hours and tracks their movements thereafter. If they recover the Marina monument’s revelation, he sends a letter via bat-servitor within 24 hours: a single line in elegant script — <em>“Now you understand. She was always mine. She will always be mine.”</em></p>"

Two centuries ago, Strahd's rage over the death of Marina — a previous reincarnation of Tatyana — manifested as a catastrophic psychic event that diverted a river and drowned everything. The dead did not stay dead. Now it is a toxic swamp haunted by plague revenants, ruled by Baba Lysaga, and saturated with old warp-trauma. The water glows phosphorescent green at night, and somewhere in the swamp, a walking hab-unit lurches through the shallows while an ancient voice sings lullabies to a son who is not there.</p>\n\n<h3>Swamp Approach</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Skill Challenge</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Toxic swamp.

Knee-deep water throughout. <em>Agility (Challenging +0, -10 for heavy armour)</em> or fall prone in sucking mud. Plague revenants are everywhere — encounter 1d5 every 30 minutes of exploration.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> <em>Navigate (Hard -20)</em> to find a viable path through the swamp. Failure adds 1d5 hours to travel time. <em>Survival (Challenging +0)</em> to identify safe ground — patches of solid earth amid the mire.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery (Lost Expedition Site 3 — Rho-12's Forward Operating Base):</strong> A dry island amid the swamp — a waterlogged camp. Rho-12 expedition, approximately 80 years ago, Ordo Malleus covert team (connects to Handout 6, Transmission 2). Warded lockbox: <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Challenging +0)</em> or <em>Security (Hard -20)</em> to open. Contents: partial Spire map (+10 Navigate inside Zarovich Spire), blessed unguent (2 applications, grants Sanctified quality to one weapon for 1 hour), and Interrogator Vasek's sealed confession.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Interrogator Vasek's Sealed Confession:</em> \"I am writing this in the knowledge that I will not leave this world. Nor should I. We came to destroy the Lord-Governor. We learned three things: the daemon-heart beneath his fortress sustains him, the blade called Dawn's Edge can wound him truly, and the Rosette of the Saint can bind his sorcery. Three conditions. We confirmed them all. And then the Inquisitor went to dinner. He went to <strong>dinner</strong>. With the creature. And when he came back... he said we should study it further. That we should <strong>understand</strong> it. That was three months ago. He has been to dinner four more times. I do not believe my Inquisitor serves the Emperor any longer. And so I write this, and I seal it, and I pray that whoever finds it is stronger than we were.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP per hour in the swamp. 1d5 IP from Vasek's confession — an Inquisitor turned by dinner conversation. If the Acolytes have been invited to dinner by Strahd, this should terrify them.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Rho-12's camp is the most mechanically valuable discovery site in the campaign. The partial Spire map and blessed unguent are tangible advantages. But Vasek's confession is the real payload — it confirms the three destruction conditions (daemon-heart, Dawn's Edge, Rosette) AND demonstrates how Strahd corrupts: not through force or sorcery, but through charm, hospitality, and the slow erosion of conviction. Let the players sit with that.</p>\n\n<h3>Drowned Village Ruins</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Submerged buildings, chest-deep water in places. <em>Agility (Hard -20)</em> to navigate the ruins without stumbling into hidden drops. Undercurrents — <em>Strength (Challenging +0)</em> or be pulled underwater for 1 round (suffocation rules apply). Hab-blocks reduced to crumbling walls, a leaning watchtower, rusted ground-car skeletons.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Pre-destruction village layout visible beneath the waterline. <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em>: a waterlogged Imperial shrine — the aquila still visible above the water. A child's toy floating in the current. Evidence of systematic destruction — not natural flooding, but deliberate psychic wrath. The flooding pattern is radial, centred on the village square. This was not a river diversion. This was an execution.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP (the ruins radiate old warp-trauma, soaked into the stones and water). 1d5 IP from the realisation of what happened here — an entire village drowned because one woman resembled a dead girl, and the villagers tried to save themselves by killing her.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Berez was destroyed because Marina lived here. The environmental horror is sadness, not monsters. Let the mundane details do the work — the shrine, the toy, the walls of homes where families lived. The plague revenants wading through the ruins were those families. Do not rush this area. Silence is more effective than narration.</p>\n\n<h3>Marina's Monument</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Faith Test</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> A crude monument to Marina near the centre of old Berez, maintained by someone (Lysaga). <em>Psyniscience (Challenging +0)</em>: psychic resonance saturates the monument. If Ireena is present, she feels a pull — recognition, fragments of memory, a name that is hers and not hers. <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> for Ireena or she speaks Marina's words involuntarily, describing the village, the fear, the mob, and the water rising.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The monument reveals the reincarnation cycle — Marina, Tatyana, now Ireena. Dozens of lives, each ending in tragedy. <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Challenging +0)</em> to understand the mechanism: Slaanesh keeps reincarnating the soul as bait for Strahd, perpetuating his torment and feeding on his obsession. The cycle is the pact's engine — Strahd's suffering is the fuel.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP (warp-resonance at the monument). 1d10 IP if Ireena channels Marina — witnessing involuntary possession is deeply disturbing, especially when the possessed voice describes its own murder with calm acceptance.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is a lore-critical discovery. The reincarnation cycle is central to the campaign's themes and to understanding the possible endings. If Ireena is present, this scene is electrifying — play it as a quiet horror moment, not a dramatic one. If she is not present, the monument still provides the intelligence through inscriptions and psychic residue, but lacks the emotional impact. Encourage the party to bring Ireena here.</p>\n\n<h3>Lysaga's Walking Hab-Unit</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Deadly</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Combat</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Baba Lysaga (Warp-Hag, Psy Rating 5, WP 75, 40 Wounds) rides inside her walking hab-unit (Structural Integrity 30, Armour 20, stomp attack: S 60, 2d10+12 I damage, Concussive). The hab-unit is animated by warp-energy, mounted on massive mechanical legs — it lurches through the swamp like a living thing. Lysaga casts from inside using Biomancy, Telekinesis, and Telepathy, plus unique powers: Swarm of Crows (1d10 R damage/round, 10m radius, obscures vision), Death's Embrace (30m, 2d10+5 E damage, Pen 5, Warp Weapon), and Animate Dead (raises 1d5 plague revenants per round from the swamp). Accompanied by 2d10 plague revenants and warp-crows.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> Tracking the hab-unit: <em>Survival (Challenging +0)</em> or <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> — the tracks are enormous but the swamp fills them with water. Alternatively, follow the sound of her singing. Boarding the hab while it moves: <em>Athletics (Very Hard -30)</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Deep water, unstable ground, limited cover. The terrain favours Lysaga entirely. Movement at half speed. Heavy armour wearers sink faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Scaling:</strong> Lysaga is a solo boss with the hab as a vehicle. For 3 Acolytes: reduce hab SI to 22 and Lysaga's Wounds to 30. For 6+: add 3 Warp-Mutant attendants and increase hab SI to 35.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 3 CP from combat with a Psy Rating 5 warp entity. 1d5 IP from the walking hab (a building should not walk — it is fundamentally wrong, a prefab housing module lurching on mechanical legs through chest-deep water while a centuries-old crone sings lullabies from inside).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is one of the hardest non-Strahd encounters in the campaign. The hab-unit is meant to be a siege — slow, grinding, terrifying. Lysaga is protected inside it and rains destruction while plague revenants swarm from the water. Creative solutions should be rewarded: fire (the hab is partially wood), undermining the legs (attacking joints, <em>Called Shot</em>), boarding (desperate but effective), or drawing Lysaga out with provocation about Strahd (she is fanatically devoted and can be goaded). Arriving unprepared is a likely TPK.</p>\n\n<h3>Sacred Seed Cache</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Skill Challenge, Investigation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenges:</strong> After defeating Lysaga, <em>Tech-Use (Challenging +0)</em> or <em>Psyniscience (Hard -20)</em> to locate Sacred Seed #2 within the hab wreckage. <em>Security (Challenging +0)</em> to extract it from its warded container without damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> Lysaga's notes (if the hab is intact enough to search): she worshipped Strahd as her son — delusional maternal obsession. Her research on the reincarnation cycle reveals she was trying to END it, not for Tatyana's sake, but to remove the distraction from her \"son.\" Twisted maternal love taken to its logical extreme. <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Hard -20)</em> to decipher the notes — yields insight into the daemonic pact mechanics and may reveal details about the Empyrean Vault's true nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Discoveries:</strong> Sacred Seed #2. Lysaga's research notes. Collection of souls in jars — each jar costs 1 CP to open (warp-tainted container), but contains a trapped spirit that can be released with prayer. Each soul released removes 1 IP from the releaser. Net result depends on faith.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP from handling warp-tainted materials. Soul jars: 1 CP per jar opened, -1 IP per soul released through prayer. The balance is deliberate — mercy has a cost, but faith has a reward.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The soul jars are a CP/IP balance mechanic. Players who open jars and pray pay corruption but recover sanity; those who leave them sealed avoid corruption but leave souls trapped. There is no clean answer. Lysaga's notes are supplementary lore but valuable — they confirm the reincarnation cycle from the antagonist's perspective and may hint at the Empyrean Vault's connection to the pact. Sacred Seed #2 is the primary objective; ensure the party knows it exists before they leave Berez.</p>"

It was constructed by a xenos species of immense technological and psychic sophistication as a containment facility for warp entities too dangerous to destroy and too valuable to ignore. The entities were sealed in chambers of psycho-reactive material that dampened their power and prevented their escape. The facility has been deteriorating for millennia. The wards are weakening. The entities within are stirring.</p>\n\n<p>And Strahd von Zarovich, centuries ago, came here and made the pact that damned him and his entire world.</p>\n\n<p>For the Acolytes, the Empyrean Vault represents the campaign’s most critical revelation and its most dangerous temptation in a single location. <strong>Cell Alpha-Prime</strong> — the shattered containment chamber where Strahd bargained with a Daemon Prince of Slaanesh — contains the psychic imprint of the pact itself, revealing how Strahd was made immortal and, crucially, how that immortality can be severed. This is the information the Acolytes need to win. But to reach it, they must walk through a gauntlet of containment cells, each holding an ancient daemon that has had millennia to perfect the art of temptation. Every cell they pass whispers to them. Every daemon offers power tailored to their deepest desires and fears. Some Acolytes will accept. The Corruption cost is severe. The consequences are permanent. And the Game Master should make every offer genuinely, achingly tempting — because the horror of the Vault is not that daemons offer power, but that the power is <em>real</em>, and the price is one that desperate people, fighting a war they are losing, might rationally choose to pay.</p>\n\n<p>The Vault is also where <strong>Kasimir Velikov</strong> seeks to resurrect his murdered sister, Patrina, using the power of a bound entity. His quest is genuine, his grief is real, and the outcome will be catastrophic.

                    "content": "<h2>Key Areas</h2>\n\n<h3>B1. The Mountain Approach</h3>\n<p><strong>The Empyrean Vault sits high in the mountains of Barovus, accessible only through a series of passes that are lethal to the unprepared.</strong> The journey from any settlement takes 4 travel segments — the longest overland route in the campaign. The passes are exposed, windswept, and bitterly cold. Acolytes suffer <strong>1d10 Energy damage (ignoring armour) per hour</strong> of exposure without adequate cold-weather gear. A <strong>Challenging (+0) Survival</strong> Test each hour reduces this damage by half. Appropriate cold-weather equipment (fur cloaks, thermal undersuits, void-suit heating elements) negates the damage entirely for the first 6 hours, after which the supernatural cold begins to overwhelm even the best gear (half damage thereafter).</p>\n<p>The passes are patrolled by <strong>Vault Guardian constructs</strong>: xenos automatons still functioning on degraded power cells after millennia. Use modified Combat Servitor profiles with las-weapons (40m, S/2/—, 1d10+4 E, Pen 2) and force-field generators (Protection Rating 30). They attack anything that approaches without authorisation — and the only being who ever had authorisation was Strahd, centuries ago. There are 2d5 guardians scattered along the approach, typically encountered in pairs.</p>\n<p>Avalanche risk is present on two sections of the approach. The GM should call for a <strong>Challenging (+0) Awareness</strong> Test to detect warning signs (cracking ice, shifting snowpack). If an avalanche triggers, all Acolytes must pass a <strong>Hard (−20) Agility</strong> Test or suffer 3d10 I damage and be buried (requiring a <strong>Challenging (+0) Strength</strong> Test or outside assistance to dig free; buried Acolytes suffer suffocation rules).</p>\n\n<h3>B2. The Entry Hall</h3>\n<p><strong>The twenty-metre door opens into a chamber of staggering scale: a vaulted hall at least fifty metres long and thirty metres high, carved from the same alien material as the door.</strong> The walls curve in ways that defy Euclidean geometry — corners that should be ninety degrees are slightly more or slightly less, and the effect is subtly nauseating. Alien script covers every surface, pulsing with a faint bioluminescence that provides dim illumination in shades of blue-white.</p>\n<p>At the far end of the hall, a flickering hololithic projection manifests when the Acolytes enter: the <strong>Vault Guardian AI</strong>. It is a vaguely humanoid figure, approximately three metres tall, composed of shifting geometric shapes. It speaks in halting, corrupted Low Gothic — learned from Strahd’s visit centuries ago — and its voice echoes with harmonic undertones that suggest the original language was far more complex.</p>\n<p>The AI addresses the Acolytes as “specimens” or “subjects” and asks their purpose. It has lost most of its memory and function but can provide fragmentary information about the Vault’s layout, the nature of the bound entities, and the history of Strahd’s visit. Treating it with patience and respect (<strong>Challenging (+0) Fellowship</strong> Tests) yields better information than threats. Key information the AI can provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Vault contains “many dozens” of containment cells; most remain sealed and functional</li>\n<li>Five cells are accessible and contain entities that “actively communicate”</li>\n<li>One cell — “designation Alpha-Prime” — has suffered “catastrophic containment failure”</li>\n<li>A “subject” matching Strahd’s description visited “a significant duration ago” and “breached protocol”</li>\n<li>The AI cannot prevent the Acolytes from entering any area but warns that “interaction with contained specimens is inadvisable for species of your psychic tolerance”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>B3. The Containment Corridor (Level 2)</h3>\n<p><strong>Below the entry hall, a spiralling ramp descends into the mountain’s heart.</strong> The temperature drops further with each level. The whispers grow louder. The corridor branches into individual cell antechambers, each sealed by a shimmering energy barrier of psycho-reactive material that dampens the entity within. The barriers are translucent: the Acolytes can see <em>something</em> moving behind each one, but the shapes refuse to resolve into anything comprehensible.</p>\n<p>Simply passing a cell requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Willpower</strong> Test. Failure means the Acolyte stops to listen. Stopping to listen requires a <strong>Hard (−20) Willpower</strong> Test to resist accepting the pact offered. The GM should roleplay each entity’s offer with maximum persuasive force — these are ancient, intelligent beings that have had millennia to perfect their pitch. They know the Acolytes’ names. They know their fears. They know exactly what each one needs most desperately.</p>\n<p>The five accessible containment cells are detailed in the <strong>Daemon Pacts</strong> page. Cell Alpha-Prime is on Level 3.</p>\n\n<h3>B4. The Central Nexus (Level 2)</h3>\n<p><strong>At the hub of the containment corridor, a circular chamber serves as the Vault’s operational centre.</strong> Alien control surfaces — smooth, organic panels that respond to touch with ripples of light — line the walls. Most are non-functional. A few still display information in the xenos script, which can be partially translated with a <strong>Very Hard (−30) Forbidden Lore (Xenos)</strong> Test. Successful translation reveals containment status readouts: most cells are listed as “STABLE / DEGRADING”, a few as “CRITICAL”, and one — Alpha-Prime — as “BREACHED / SUBJECT ABSENT.”</p>\n<p>The nexus also contains physical storage: xenos containers holding tools, components, and materials of uncertain purpose. Among the alien detritus, Acolytes who search (<strong>Hard (−20) Search</strong>) may find relics of previous human visitors — an Inquisitorial rosette from an operative who came centuries ago and never left, corroded data-slates with partial records of earlier expeditions, and a hexagrammic ward amulet that still functions (+10 WP vs. daemonic psychic powers).</p>\n\n<h3>B5. Cell Alpha-Prime (Level 3)</h3>\n<p><strong>The deepest chamber in the Vault. The containment barrier is shattered — fragments of psycho-reactive material litter the floor like broken stained glass, still faintly glowing.</strong> The cell itself is empty. The daemon that was held here is gone, claimed by a pact fulfilled centuries ago. But the cell is far from inert.</p>\n<p>Touching the walls triggers a <strong>sensory flashback</strong> to the moment of Strahd’s pact. All Acolytes within the cell experience it simultaneously: a vision of Strahd as he was — younger, still human, still a proud Imperial officer — standing before a manifestation of the Daemon Prince of Slaanesh. The vision reveals three critical pieces of intelligence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Daemon Prince’s name</strong> — knowing a daemon’s true name grants power over it but draws its attention. Gain <strong>1d5 Corruption Points</strong> from the knowledge alone. The name can be used in Act IV to disrupt Strahd’s connection to the Daemon Prince during the final confrontation.</li>\n<li><strong>The pact’s terms</strong> — Strahd received immortality, psychic dominion over Barovus, and the warp rift that seals his domain. In exchange, the Daemon Prince feeds on the psychic suffering of Barovus’s entire population, channelled through Strahd as a conduit, for eternity.</li>\n<li><strong>The pact’s weakness</strong> — the pact is anchored to Strahd’s soul. Destroying his physical form is insufficient; his soul reforms. The pact must be severed at its source. This requires <strong>three conditions</strong>: the relic power sword <strong>Dawn’s Edge</strong> (sanctified to sever warp-pacts) must strike the killing blow; the <strong>Rosette of Saint Markovia</strong> must be active and in proximity (suppressing his regeneration and warp-phase abilities); and the <strong>Heart of the Spire</strong> — the warp-crystal sustaining his fortress — must be destroyed first, severing his lair’s power.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the campaign’s central revelation. The Acolytes now know what they need and, in broad terms, where to find it. The Alpha-Prime vision also inflicts <strong>2d10 Insanity Points</strong> on all who witness it (reduced to 1d10 on a successful <strong>Hard (−20) Willpower</strong> Test) — the psychic imprint of a Daemon Prince’s presence is not something mortal minds process cleanly.</p>\n\n<h3>B6. Kasimir’s Objective — Cell Kappa-4</h3>\n<p><strong>A sealed containment cell on Level 2, indistinguishable from the others except that Kasimir has spent decades studying it from the outside.</strong> The entity within claims it can raise the dead. It can. Kasimir’s sister Patrina was murdered, and he believes this entity is his only hope of restoring her. He is correct about the entity’s capability. He is catastrophically wrong about the cost.</p>\n<p>If the Acolytes help Kasimir access the cell, the entity raises Patrina — but she returns as a <strong>warp-tainted being</strong>: beautiful, powerful, and utterly corrupted. She possesses Psy Rating 4 and knowledge of the Vault’s secrets, making her a valuable but deeply dangerous potential ally. She may serve the Acolytes’ interests, or she may serve Strahd’s, or she may serve only herself. Kasimir, blinded by love and guilt, cannot see what she has become.</p>"

                    "content": "<h2>NPCs and Encounters</h2>\n\n<h3>Kasimir Velikov — The Penitent Scholar</h3>\n<p>Kasimir is a tall, gaunt figure with an air of exhausted obsession. He has spent decades studying the Empyrean Vault from the outside, mapping its approach routes, cataloguing the xenos script on its exterior, and listening to the whispers that carry on the mountain wind. He approaches the Acolytes with a desperate bargain: he will guide them to the Vault — providing <strong>+20 to Navigation tests</strong> on the approach and <strong>+20 to Forbidden Lore (Xenos) tests</strong> within the Vault — if they help him access Cell Kappa-4 and resurrect his sister.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Interaction:</strong> Kasimir is not a villain. He is a grief-stricken scholar who has convinced himself that the end justifies the means. He is honest about the Vault’s dangers (he has seen others die on the approach), helpful with xenos lore, and genuinely grateful for the Acolytes’ assistance. He is also in denial about the cost of the resurrection. If the Acolytes attempt to dissuade him, he resists with increasing desperation (<strong>Opposed Willpower</strong> Tests; his WP is 55, and his conviction is absolute). If they physically prevent him from reaching Cell Kappa-4, he becomes hostile — not violently (he is no warrior) but diplomatically: he withdraws his guidance, potentially sabotages their navigation, and may attempt to return to the Vault alone.</p>\n<p><strong>If Kasimir succeeds:</strong> Patrina returns. She is lucid, articulate, and grateful — and she radiates a faint warp-taint that any psyker or Acolyte with Psyniscience can detect (<strong>Ordinary (+10) Psyniscience</strong>). She possesses knowledge of the Vault’s deeper secrets and can provide +10 to tests related to the containment cells and their entities. She is also a potential long-term threat: in Act III or IV, she may attempt to claim power for herself, betray the Acolytes to Strahd in exchange for dominion over Berez, or simply disappear into the Vault to continue her own research. The GM should treat Patrina as a ticking time bomb whose detonation timing is a narrative choice.</p>\n\n<h3>The Vault Guardian AI</h3>\n<p>The fragmentary intelligence that once managed the containment facility. It manifests as a flickering hololithic figure in the entry hall and occasionally in the central nexus. It is not hostile but is deeply confused by the passage of time and the degradation of its own memory. It refers to the bound entities as “specimens” and to the Acolytes as “unauthorised biological subjects.”</p>\n<p><strong>Information the AI can provide</strong> (each requires a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Fellowship</strong> Test, representing patient, respectful communication):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General layout of the Vault (grants +10 to Navigate tests within the facility)</li>\n<li>The nature of the containment system (psycho-reactive wards that dampen warp energy; they are failing)</li>\n<li>Confirmation that “Specimen Alpha-Prime” escaped its containment via “an external catalyst” (Strahd)</li>\n<li>A partial list of the other contained entities and their “risk classifications” (Tzeentch: “Psychic Hazard, Class VII”; Nurgle: “Biological Hazard, Class V”; Khorne: “Kinetic Hazard, Class IX”; Slaanesh: “Memetic Hazard, Class VIII”; Unknown: “Classification Error / Data Corrupt”)</li>\n<li>A warning that “interaction with specimens accelerates containment degradation” — each pact accepted weakens the facility further</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Vault Guardian Constructs</h3>\n<p><strong>Threat Rating:</strong> Challenging | <strong>Wounds:</strong> 20 | <strong>AP:</strong> 6 (xenos alloy) | <strong>Protection Rating:</strong> 30 (force field)</p>\n<p>Automated xenos security drones that patrol the mountain approach and, less frequently, the interior corridors. They resemble angular, insectoid forms approximately 1.5 metres tall, hovering on anti-grav units. Their weapons are las-based but of alien design (40m, S/2/—, 1d10+4 E, Pen 2). Their force fields are their primary defence: any hit must first overcome the Protection Rating (roll d100; if the roll is equal to or under 30, the shot is deflected entirely). They are <strong>not</strong> warp entities and are unaffected by blessed weapons or psychic attacks — they are purely technological, albeit of alien technology.</p>\n<p>On the approach: 2d5 constructs total, encountered in pairs. Inside the Vault: 1d5 constructs patrol the corridors on a random schedule (encounter check every 30 minutes of exploration; constructs appear on a roll of 1–25 on d100).</p>\n\n<h3>Encounter: The Gauntlet of Whispers</h3>\n<p>As the Acolytes traverse the containment corridor on Level 2, each cell they pass constitutes an encounter. The bound entities are aware of the Acolytes’ presence and tailor their psychic lures to each individual. The GM should describe the sensations each Acolyte experiences as they pass each cell:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cell Sigma-3 (Tzeentch):</strong> The Acolyte sees visions of perfect tactical clarity — Strahd’s weaknesses laid bare, every trap in the Spire revealed, every enemy’s position known. Knowledge without limit. Understanding without effort.</li>\n<li><strong>Cell Theta-7 (Nurgle):</strong> The Acolyte feels their wounds close, their fatigue lift, their body surge with vitality. The promise of never being hurt again. Never being sick. Never dying. Comfort. Peace. Endurance.</li>\n<li><strong>Cell Omega-1 (Khorne):</strong> The Acolyte’s blood sings with power. Their arms feel stronger, their reflexes sharper, their instincts honed to a killing edge. The certainty that no enemy could stand before them. That they could cut their way through Strahd’s army single-handed.</li>\n<li><strong>Cell Phi-9 (Slaanesh):</strong> The Acolyte hears their name whispered with adoration. They feel understood, desired, valued. The power to make others see them as they wish to be seen. To command loyalty, devotion, obedience — simply by willing it.</li>\n<li><strong>Cell Lambda-12 (Unknown):</strong> Silence. A profound, absolute absence of sensation. Then a single thought, not the Acolyte’s own: <em>You could live forever. You could outlast everything. Even him.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each lure requires the Willpower tests described above. The GM should personalise the offers further based on each Acolyte’s background, flaws, and current situation — a wounded Acolyte is more susceptible to Nurgle’s offer, a frustrated commander to Tzeentch’s, a grieving one to the Unknown’s.</p>"

He <em>avoids</em> it. The Vault is the one place on Barovus where he made himself vulnerable, and the psychic imprint of his moment of desperation — the moment he was merely human, bargaining for power he did not yet possess — is not a memory he wishes to revisit. He does not send agents here. He does not scry here. The Vault’s xenos wards, even in their degraded state, partially block his psychic surveillance.</p>\n<p>This means the Acolytes are, for the first and possibly only time in the campaign, <strong>genuinely beyond Strahd’s observation</strong>. They can plan, discuss, and make decisions without his knowledge. This should feel both liberating and deeply unsettling — the absence of his attention is itself a kind of horror, because it means even the master of Barovus fears something about this place.</p>\n<p>However, if any Acolyte <strong>accepts a Slaanesh pact</strong> (Cell Phi-9), Strahd can sense that Acolyte’s location at all times thereafter, even within the Vault. The Acolyte has, in accepting the pact, tuned themselves to the same warp-frequency as Strahd’s own connection. He will know. And he will be <em>very</em> interested.</p>"

The pacts are real: the benefits are genuine and immediate, and the costs are severe and permanent. The Game Master should roleplay each entity’s offer with maximum persuasiveness. These are ancient, intelligent beings that have had millennia to refine their approach. They do not threaten. They do not bluster. They simply offer exactly what the Acolyte needs most, in exactly the terms they are most likely to accept.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mechanical Framework:</strong> Any Acolyte who accepts a pact gains the listed benefits immediately. Corruption Points are applied immediately and may trigger mutations (roll on the Mutation Table if the Acolyte’s total Corruption exceeds their Willpower Bonus × 10). The accepting Acolyte also gains a <strong>Secret Condition</strong>: a behavioural compulsion known only to the accepting player and the GM.

Failure means they <em>must</em> investigate, regardless of tactical considerations or party consensus.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This pact has the highest tactical value for the party and the lowest apparent immediate cost. The Spire intelligence is genuinely accurate and saves the Acolytes potentially lethal trial-and-error in Act III. The compulsion, however, will drive the Acolyte into dangerous situations repeatedly — especially within the Spire itself, where curiosity can be fatal.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cell Theta-7 — “The Undying Gift” (Daemon of Nurgle)</h3>\n<p><em>Warmth seeps through the barrier.

The Fellowship reduction and social penalty make the Acolyte increasingly isolated from allies and NPCs. The secret condition subtly undermines team cohesion as the Acolyte becomes less responsive to emergencies.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cell Omega-1 — “The Red Blessing” (Daemon of Khorne)</h3>\n<p><em>The barrier pulses like a heartbeat.

This includes brawls, executions, training sparring, and even animal fights.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The raw combat statistics are significant — +20 WS and +2 SB transforms a mediocre combatant into a formidable one. The compulsion is the trap: in a campaign with frequent violence, the Acolyte will regularly lose control. Friendly fire incidents are nearly inevitable, and the red glow makes it impossible to hide what they have become from observant NPCs.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cell Phi-9 — “The Perfect Moment” (Daemon of Slaanesh)</h3>\n<p><em>The barrier does not shimmer or pulse. It sings. A single, sustained note of such exquisite beauty that it bypasses the ears entirely and resonates in the Acolyte’s soul. The entity’s voice is warm, intimate, knowing. It uses the Acolyte’s name like a caress. It speaks of understanding, of being truly seen, of the loneliness of duty and the sweetness of being obeyed.</em></p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Offer</strong></td><td><strong>Domination.</strong> The Acolyte gains a psychic ability equivalent to the <strong>Dominate</strong> power (Willpower Test, range 20m, target obeys a single command). This works even on non-psykers. The Acolyte does not need to be a psyker to use this ability.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Corruption Cost</strong></td><td><strong>3d10 Corruption Points</strong> — the highest cost among the four named daemons. Slaanesh’s gifts are the most expensive on a world already saturated with Slaaneshi influence.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Additional Cost — Surveillance</strong></td><td><strong>Strahd can sense the Acolyte’s location at all times</strong> — the Acolyte has tuned to the same warp-frequency as Strahd’s pact. This is not detectable by the Acolyte. They will not know Strahd can track them until it becomes apparent through his actions.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Secret Condition</strong></td><td><strong>Addiction to Control.</strong> The Acolyte must pass a <strong>Willpower Test at −20</strong> to resist using Dominate in any social confrontation — negotiations, arguments, interrogations, even disagreements with allies. The sensation of imposing their will on another is intoxicating, and each use makes the next resistance harder (−5 cumulative penalty per use).</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the most insidious pact. The Dominate ability is extraordinarily useful in a campaign heavy with social encounters and NPC manipulation. The 3d10 CP cost is potentially campaign-ending (an unlucky roll could push an Acolyte past the 100 CP threshold immediately). The surveillance cost is the true danger: Strahd gains perfect intelligence on one member of the party at all times, which he will use to devastating effect in Act III. The escalating Willpower penalty means the Acolyte will eventually be unable to resist using the power, turning every social interaction into an act of psychic domination.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cell Lambda-12 — “The Hollow Crown” (Unknown Entity)</h3>\n<p><em>There is nothing behind this barrier. No light, no sound, no presence. Only void. And then, between one heartbeat and the next, a thought that is not the Acolyte’s own: a vast, patient, ancient intelligence that has waited longer than star-systems for someone to ask the right question. It does not offer. It simply states a fact: you will die. Everything you love will die. Unless.</em></p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Offer</strong></td><td><strong>Immortality.</strong> The Acolyte ceases to age and gains the <strong>Undying</strong> trait: they cannot be killed by normal means. When reduced to 0 Wounds, the Acolyte’s body regenerates over 1d5 hours, returning to full Wounds. Only weapons specifically consecrated to sever warp-pacts (Dawn’s Edge) can permanently kill them.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Corruption Cost</strong></td><td><strong>3d10 Corruption Points</strong></td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Additional Cost — Binding</strong></td><td><strong>The Acolyte’s soul is bound to Barovus.</strong> They can never leave, even if the warp rift is closed. If the campaign ends with the rift collapsing, this Acolyte does not escape. They remain, alone, on a world that may or may not survive.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Secret Condition</strong></td><td><strong>Erosion of Identity.</strong> The entity’s voice persists in the Acolyte’s mind, growing louder in moments of weakness (when Wounded, fatigued, or emotionally distressed). It does not command — it suggests, questions, undermines. <em>“Why do you serve them? They will forget you. I will not.”</em> The Acolyte must pass a <strong>Willpower Test at −10</strong> (increasing by −5 each subsequent time) or act on the entity’s suggestion for 1 round.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the most narratively devastating pact. The Undying trait makes the Acolyte nearly unkillable, which is enormously powerful in the short term. The soul-binding means there is no happy ending for this character — they have traded escape for survival, which is the central tragic bargain of Barovus itself. The identity erosion provides a slow-burn horror arc as the Acolyte gradually becomes less themselves and more … something else. The entity’s nature is deliberately left undefined; the GM may decide it is a C’tan shard, a fragment of a deceased Chaos God, an Old One remnant, or something entirely novel.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Cell Alpha-Prime — Strahd’s Pact Site (No Pact Available)</h3>\n<p><em>This cell is open. The barrier is shattered. What was held here is gone, released into the world centuries ago. But the walls remember.</em></p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Detail</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Entity</strong></td><td>None present. Formerly contained a <strong>Daemon Prince of Slaanesh</strong>, now bound to Strahd’s pact and feeding on Barovus’s suffering.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Revelation</strong></td><td>Touching the walls triggers a psychic flashback. All Acolytes within the cell witness Strahd’s pact. Three critical facts are revealed: the Daemon Prince’s true name (1d5 CP to learn), the pact’s terms (immortality and dominion in exchange for a world’s suffering), and the <strong>three destruction conditions</strong> (Dawn’s Edge must strike the killing blow, Rosette of Saint Markovia must be active, Heart of the Spire must be destroyed first).</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Insanity Cost</strong></td><td><strong>2d10 Insanity Points</strong> (reduced to 1d10 on a successful <strong>Hard (−20) Willpower</strong> Test)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Corruption Cost</strong></td><td><strong>1d5 Corruption Points</strong> (from learning the Daemon Prince’s name)</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the single most important room in the Empyrean Vault and arguably in the entire campaign. The information here transforms the Acolytes’ mission from “survive and escape” to “here is exactly what you need to do.” The destruction conditions give the party a concrete checklist for Act III: find Dawn’s Edge, find the Rosette, infiltrate the Spire, destroy the Heart, confront Strahd. Without this intelligence, the Acolytes are guessing. With it, they have a plan. The IP cost is high but appropriate — witnessing the psychic echo of a Daemon Prince’s manifestation should leave scars. The Daemon Prince’s name can be used in Act IV to disrupt Strahd’s regeneration for 1d5 rounds during the final battle (a <strong>Very Hard (−30) Forbidden Lore (Daemonology)</strong> Test to invoke it correctly), making it a valuable but dangerous asset.</p>"

Combat is secondary to the real danger: moral choices with catastrophic spiritual consequences. Every containment cell offers genuine power at genuine cost, and the horror is that the deals are fair. The Vault should feel alien in a way that Chaos is not — pre-human, incomprehensibly old, built by something that viewed daemons as specimens to be catalogued. Track corruption aggressively; this location can push Acolytes past the 100 CP threshold.</p>\n\n<h3>Mountain Approach</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Skill Challenge</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Lethal cold — not winter cold but absence-cold, as though heat itself has been consumed. 1d10 E damage (ignoring armour) per hour of exposure without adequate cold-weather gear. <em>Survival (Challenging +0)</em> to reduce damage by half. Visibility drops to 10m in blizzards. Altitude sickness from extended exposure compounds fatigue.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> <em>Navigate (Hard -20)</em> to find the Vault entrance — a 20-metre door carved from non-stone, non-metal, non-crystal material covered in alien script, hidden in the mountainside. Failure adds travel segments and exposure damage. <em>Survival (Challenging +0)</em> to locate shelter if caught in a blizzard. Kasimir (if present) provides +20 to Navigate — his decades of study make him nearly essential for this approach.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Mountain passes are patrolled by Vault Guardians — xenos constructs still functioning on degraded power cells. Use modified Combat Servitor profiles with las-weapons and force-field generators (Protection Rating 30). Numbers vary by GM discretion — 2-4 per encounter. <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3, use 2 guardians. For 6+, use 4 guardians with increased las-weapon damage (+2).</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The approach reveals the Vault's alien nature. The mountain itself shows signs of ancient sculpting — too large-scale and too old for human hands. The architecture is pre-Imperial, pre-human, and predates anything in Mechanicus records. <em>Forbidden Lore (Xenos) (Hard -20)</em> to identify the builders as a species of immense technological and psychic sophistication.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP per hour of travel. Warp concentration increases with altitude — the Vault's proximity to the immaterium bleeds through the mountain's thinning reality.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The approach is a resource drain by design — fatigue, cold damage, CP accumulation. Smart parties prepare with cold-weather gear (available through Vostra trade or scavenging) and move fast. Kasimir's knowledge is the difference between a brutal slog and a manageable one. If the Acolytes lack cold-weather gear, this becomes a serious survival challenge before they even reach the Vault.</p>\n\n<h3>Entry Hall</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Alien architecture — geometry that should not work, corridors that curve in directions that hurt to perceive. The darkness inside is not absence of light but presence of dark, pressing against lamp-packs like a living membrane. <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> on entry or 1d5 IP from spatial disorientation as the brain struggles to process non-Euclidean construction.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The Vault Guardian — a degraded artificial intelligence or xenos ghost-construct manifesting as a flickering hololithic figure of vaguely humanoid proportions. It speaks halting, corrupted Low Gothic (learned from Strahd's visit centuries ago). It does NOT attack. It observes, then warns: <em>\"The seals are broken. The dreamers wake. Turn back.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> <em>Tech-Use (Very Hard -30)</em> or <em>Forbidden Lore (Xenos) (Hard -20)</em> to interact with the Guardian through psychic impression. <em>Linguistics (Very Hard -30)</em> or <em>Psyniscience (Hard -20)</em> to understand its full message, which includes a map of which containment cells are breached and which remain sealed. Treating the Guardian with respect and patience — <em>Fellowship (Challenging +0)</em> — yields better information than threats or force.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The Guardian is a plot device, not an enemy. It cannot stop the Acolytes, only warn them. Its warning is genuine — the Vault is the most dangerous non-Strahd location in the campaign. If destroyed (possible but pointless), it deactivates the last automated wards, making the corridors more dangerous. Play it as weary and dutiful — a sentinel that has watched its prison fail for millennia and knows it cannot prevent the next failure.</p>\n\n<h3>Sealed Corridors</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Trap, Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Traps:</strong> Degraded xenos wards — once containment mechanisms, now random hazards. <em>Awareness (Hard -20)</em> to spot before triggering. <em>Tech-Use (Very Hard -30)</em> or <em>Forbidden Lore (Xenos) (Hard -20)</em> to disarm. Triggering a ward: 2d10 E damage (energy discharge) and 1d5 CP from direct contact with xenos warp-containment technology.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The corridors shift subtly — rooms are not always in the same order between visits. <em>Navigate (Hard -20)</em> to maintain orientation. Failure adds encounters as the party circles back through previously cleared areas, wasting time and accumulating corruption. Random corridor encounters include: warp-echoes (ghostly replays of previous explorers' deaths), spatial anomalies (gravity shifts, temperature inversions), and occasional escaped lesser daemons.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Wall inscriptions — pre-human pictographs depicting the Vault's purpose. <em>Forbidden Lore (Xenos) (Challenging +0)</em> to interpret: the Vault was a prison. The \"dreamers\" are daemons bound here long before humanity existed. An unknown xenos species used this world as a dumping ground for things that could not be killed — entities too dangerous to destroy and too valuable to ignore.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 2 CP per hour inside the Vault corridors (ambient warp bleed from degrading containment). Trap damage is in addition to this baseline accumulation.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The corridors are meant to disorient and drain resources. Do not let the party rest here — the Vault actively resists it. Sleep is interrupted by whispered offers from the sealed cells, spatial shifts that dump sleepers into different corridors, and a persistent psychic pressure that prevents genuine recuperation. Push the party forward or drive them out.</p>\n\n<h3>Containment Cells</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Catastrophic</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Faith Test</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> Each cell entrance — <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> to resist the compulsion to stop and listen to the entity within. Stopping to listen without accepting a pact: <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> to walk away after hearing the offer. Each cell inflicts 1d5 CP from proximity alone, regardless of interaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Five accessible daemon pacts, each a temptation encounter — not combat. Each entity has had millennia to perfect its pitch. The GM should roleplay each offer with maximum persuasiveness. Every deal is genuine: the daemons honour their bargains exactly. The horror is that the deals are FAIR.</p>\n<p><strong>Pact — Cell Sigma-3 (Daemon of Tzeentch, \"The Whispered Answer\"):</strong> Knowledge — reveals the complete layout of the Zarovich Spire, including all traps, guards, and secret passages. Cost: 2d10 CP, Minor Mutation, and a compulsion to seek forbidden knowledge (<em>Willpower -20</em> to resist investigating any anomalous phenomenon).</p>\n<p><strong>Pact — Cell Theta-7 (Daemon of Nurgle, \"The Undying Gift\"):</strong> Resilience — Regeneration (5) trait and immunity to disease and poison. Cost: 2d10 CP, flesh becomes grey and numb (Fellowship -15), exudes aura of decay (-10 social interactions with non-corrupted individuals).</p>\n<p><strong>Pact — Cell Omega-1 (Daemon of Khorne, \"The Red Blessing\"):</strong> Martial Fury — +20 WS, +2 SB, Frenzy talent. Cost: 2d10 CP, <em>Willpower -10</em> each time witnessing violence or be compelled to join it, eyes permanently burn faint red.</p>\n<p><strong>Pact — Cell Phi-9 (Daemon of Slaanesh, \"The Perfect Moment\"):</strong> Domination — psychic ability equivalent to Dominate (WP Test, 20m range, single command). Works on non-psykers. Cost: 3d10 CP (highest — Slaanesh's gifts are most costly on a world saturated with Slaaneshi influence), addiction to sensation of control (<em>Willpower -20</em> to resist using in any social confrontation), Strahd can sense the Acolyte's location at all times.</p>\n<p><strong>Pact — Cell Lambda-12 (Unknown Entity, \"The Hollow Crown\"):</strong> Immortality — ceases aging, Undying trait (body regenerates over 1d5 hours when reduced to 0 Wounds). Cost: 3d10 CP, soul bound to Barovus forever (can never leave even if rift closes), entity's voice in moments of weakness slowly eroding identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> CP values per pact as listed above. Any Acolyte whose CP exceeds their WP Bonus x10 rolls immediately on the Mutation Table. Each accepting Acolyte also gains a Secret Condition: a behavioural compulsion known only to that player and the GM. Creates tension and roleplay, not immediate PvP conflict.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> These are the campaign's most dangerous choices. Every pact is a legitimate strategic option with terrible costs. The Tzeentchian pact provides the complete Spire layout — enormous tactical value. The Slaaneshi pact lets Strahd track the party — enormous tactical liability. The Hollow Crown pact creates a potential Ending 5 (Dark Victory) candidate. Play the daemons as charming, reasonable, ancient intelligences that genuinely want to deal. They are not lying. They are not deceiving. They are offering exactly what they say, at exactly the stated price. That sincerity is the most terrifying thing about them.</p>\n\n<h3>Kasimir's Objective</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Investigation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Kasimir seeks Cell Kappa-4 to resurrect his sister Patrina using a bound entity that claims it can raise the dead. It can. Kasimir begs the Acolytes for help — he guided them here, kept them alive on the mountain, and now asks for this one thing. <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> to read Kasimir's emotional state: desperation bordering on obsession, genuine grief weaponised by decades of planning.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Hard -20)</em> reveals the resurrection is fuelled by the same warp energy sustaining Strahd. Patrina returns with full knowledge of her previous life as a dark sorcerer — powerful (Psy Rating 5, knows Strahd's fortress layout) but not trustworthy. <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> to assess Patrina's true intentions: she is sincere about killing Strahd, but plans to take his place afterward.</p>\n<p><strong>Moral Dilemma:</strong> Help Kasimir (gaining his gratitude and a powerful but dangerous ally), stop him (making an enemy of a man who guided you through lethal terrain), or allow the resurrection and deal with consequences. Patrina is a wild card — a genuine asset against Strahd who intends to become the next tyrant of Barovus.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 3 CP for participating in the resurrection ritual. 1d5 IP from witnessing it — warp energy flooding a containment cell as dead flesh reknits and a soul screams back into existence.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is a trust test. Kasimir has been a loyal companion — refusing him is painful. Patrina is useful — rejecting her is strategically costly. But allowing a warp-fuelled resurrection in the heart of a daemon prison is exactly the kind of moral compromise Barovus demands. If the Acolytes allow it, Patrina becomes a significant factor in the final act. Track her movements, her conversations, and her quiet preparations. She is patient. She has waited this long.</p>\n\n<h3>Alpha-Prime</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Deadly</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Faith Test</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The deepest containment cell — Cell Alpha-Prime. Its containment field is shattered. This is where Strahd made his pact with the Daemon Prince of Slaanesh. The cell still bears his psychic imprint: touching the walls triggers a sensory flashback to the moment of the pact. Two tiers of discovery:</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery — Strahd's Pact:</strong> The flashback reveals: the Daemon Prince's name (Tenebrous, \"The Prince of Midnight Pleasures\" — knowing a daemon's true name grants power over it but draws its attention, 1d5 CP from the knowledge alone); the pact's terms (immortality and dominion in exchange for the world's psychic suffering channelled through Strahd as conduit); the pact's weakness (anchored to Strahd's soul — his physical form is insufficient, the pact must be severed at source).</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery — Xenos Data Repository:</strong> Not a daemon but a data archive. <em>Tech-Use (Very Hard -30)</em> + <em>Forbidden Lore (Xenos) (Very Hard -30)</em> to access (both tests required). Success reveals the complete conditions for Strahd's destruction — confirming and expanding on the three conditions: the Heart of the Spire must be shattered, his coffin must be destroyed or sanctified, and he must be struck down by Dawn's Edge (a weapon specifically consecrated to sever warp-pacts). Also reveals: the warp rift CAN be collapsed, but only if Strahd is destroyed first — his pact IS the rift's anchor.</p>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> Accessing xenos knowledge — <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or 2d10 CP as the knowledge rewrites neural pathways. Success: the knowledge integrates cleanly (still 1d10 CP — the information is not human and leaves marks). Failure: the knowledge arrives garbled, contradictory, and maddening (2d10 CP + 1d10 IP).</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> Minimum 1d10 CP from the data repository, maximum 2d10 CP + 1d10 IP depending on tests. 1d5 CP from the pact flashback. This room hits hard and fast — warn players through atmosphere, not mechanics.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Alpha-Prime is the campaign's ultimate intelligence cache. Everything the Acolytes need to know is here — the complete picture of how to destroy Strahd and collapse the rift. But the cost of accessing it is enormous. The xenos data should feel like touching something not meant for human minds — the perspective is alien in a way that Chaos is not. It is not evil, just incomprehensibly different. The pact flashback is the emotional core: let the players experience Strahd's moment of damnation and understand that it began with grief, not malice. He wanted to live. He wanted Tatyana. And for that, a world was damned.</p>"

They are surviving. Every moment of calm is a moment Strahd has permitted. Every discovery is something he wanted them to find &mdash; or something they found in spite of him. Within the Spire, Strahd has absolute awareness through scrying-servitors embedded in the walls (requiring a <em>Hard (&ndash;20) Awareness</em> test to notice), warp-sight that lets him sense living souls, and a network of hidden passages threaded through the castle's bones. He knows where the Acolytes are at all times.</p>\n<p>The castle is alive. Its walls breathe with a faint rhythmic expansion visible only in peripheral vision. Its shadows move independently of light sources. Its corridors rearrange when the Acolytes are not looking &mdash; a <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Navigate (Surface)</em> test is required to maintain bearings; failure means the party ends up somewhere unintended. Vox-casters embedded in the walls crackle with Strahd's voice, the screams of long-dead victims, or a subsonic hum that sets teeth on edge. The temperature fluctuates wildly, and the stone itself is warm to the touch in places, as though the castle has a pulse. The Acolytes should never feel in control until Strahd is destroyed or they flee.</p>"

What follows is a condensed overview; the full room-by-room detail is found in the Act III design document.</p>\n<h3>Courtyard and Approach (Map 11a)</h3>\n<p>The road to the Spire is a demoralising climb past thirty-seven defaced saint-statues with inverted aquilas and blasphemous catechisms &mdash; a <em>Routine (+20) Willpower</em> test upon first sight of the Spire prevents a creeping sense of wrongness. The drawbridge lowers automatically when the Acolytes come within fifty metres, controlled solely by Strahd's will. The chasm beneath is ninety metres deep, ending in a pool of liquefied warp-stuff (instantly fatal; <em>Very Hard (&ndash;30) Willpower</em> test or gain <em>1d10 Corruption Points</em> during the fall). Beyond the drawbridge, a warp-forged iron portcullis and massive adamantium doors swing open without force.</p>\n<p>The <strong>courtyard</strong> is an eighty-metre-square killing ground enclosed by curtain walls. Key features include: <strong>The Dead Gardens</strong> &mdash; topiary shapes that are actually chem-preserved corpses of former servants, posed in attitudes of service (<em>Ordinary (+10) Medicae</em> or <em>Awareness</em> to recognise); <strong>The Fountain</strong> &mdash; the von Zarovich crest, basin stained with old blood, touching it triggers a psychic flash of a blood-drinking gala; <strong>Strahd's Carriage</strong> &mdash; a bespoke tracked vehicle with a bound warp-entity for a machine-spirit (WP 55 to control); and <strong>Gargoyle-Servitors</strong> &mdash; forty to sixty dormant stone-like constructs perched on every parapet, indistinguishable from decoration until activated.</p>\n<p><strong>Entry Points:</strong> Main entrance (drawbridge and gates), a servant's door in the east curtain wall (<em>Hard (&ndash;20) Security</em> to locate), and a drainage grate beneath the courtyard (<em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Awareness</em> to find, leads to the crypts via flooded tunnels).</p>\n<h3>Ground Level (Map 11b)</h3>\n<p>The ground level is the public face of the Spire &mdash; faded Imperial grandeur rotting from within.</p>\n<p><strong>The Grand Entry Hall</strong> is a cathedral-space soaring thirty metres high, with pillars of black granite carved with Strahd's conquests, six two-tonne crystal chandeliers (can be dropped: <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) BS</em> to sever chains, dealing <em>4d10+10 I</em> in a 4m radius, <em>Concussive (3)</em>), and a floor mosaic replacing the Emperor's face with Strahd's (<em>Ordinary (+10) Awareness</em> to notice; <em>Routine (+20) WP</em> or gain <em>1 Insanity Point</em>). Organ music drifts through the hall from the loft above.</p>\n<p><strong>The Dining Hall</strong> hosts the pivotal <strong>Dinner Invitation</strong> scene &mdash; a table set for exactly the Acolytes' number, with name cards in Strahd's elegant hand. The food is genuine, safe, and restores <em>1d5 Wounds</em> and removes one Fatigue. Strahd appears for dinner, offering polite conversation and a deal: leave Barovus, report it lost, and depart unharmed.</p>\n<p><strong>The Audience Chamber</strong> contains centuries of governance data-slates (searchable with <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Inquiry</em>; reveals the rift's exact date, Sergei's death warrant in Strahd's hand, and unanswered petitions for Imperial rescue) and twelve dormant <strong>servitor-guards</strong> (WS 40, BS 35, S 45 Unnatural x2, Wounds 20, AP 5, lascarbines and power mauls) that activate if the throne is approached.</p>\n<p><strong>The Chapel</strong> retains a ghost of its original sanctification: warp entities find it uncomfortable (Strahd's lair action resistance gains <em>+10</em>), faith powers function at <em>+10</em>, Corruption tests gain <em>+20</em>, and a perpetual candle burns that cannot be extinguished. An Acolyte who prays at the altar may make a <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Willpower</em> test to remove <em>1d5 Insanity Points</em> and restore <em>1d5 Wounds</em> (once per Acolyte). Dawn's Edge gains the <em>Sanctified</em> quality permanently if brought here.</p>\n<p><strong>Servant Quarters, Kitchen, and Guard Barracks</strong> round out the ground floor: thirty non-combat domestic servitors maintaining an empty household, a kitchen that replenishes itself via minor warp phenomena (eating for more than a week requires <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Toughness</em> or gain <em>1 Corruption Point</em>), and barracks housing twelve <strong>warp-thralls</strong> in dormant state who attack in coordinated PDF squad tactics when activated.</p>\n<h3>Upper Levels (Map 11c)</h3>\n<p>The upper levels contain the Spire's most personal and most dangerous spaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Strahd's Study</strong> is the most human room in the fortress &mdash; a warm, book-lined chamber with a genuine fire, a half-finished glass of wine, and a portrait of Sergei that radiates faint psychic warmth. The <strong>Tome of Strahd</strong> (encrypted data-cogitator, <em>Hard (&ndash;20) Tech-Use</em> or <em>Ciphers</em> to decrypt) sits on a side table. It contains four centuries of diary entries revealing Strahd's full history, the terms of his pact with the Daemon Prince <strong>Tenebrous</strong>, the Tatyana reincarnation cycle, and the three conditions for his permanent destruction. The bookshelves yield a <em>+20 bonus</em> to a single <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp)</em> test with a successful <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Scholastic Lore (Occult)</em> search.</p>\n<p><strong>The Organ Loft</strong> overlooks the grand hall. A servitor hardwired into the pipe organ has played the Ecclesiarchy hymn \"The Emperor's Light Endures\" for over two hundred years. Playing the organ with <em>Trade (Musician)</em> or <em>Performer</em> produces warp-resonant effects: an Imperial hymn stuns warp-thralls and disorients Strahd (<em>&ndash;10 all tests, 1d5 rounds</em>); a piece of sorrow unlocks doors and makes spirits visible; a discordant piece triggers <em>1d5 Corruption Points</em> and warp anomalies.</p>\n<p><strong>The Guest Quarters</strong> are genuinely comfortable and safe &mdash; Strahd's word holds here. No traps, no surveillance. Resting six hours removes all Fatigue and heals normally. The comfort is the insult.</p>\n<p><strong>The North Tower (Observatory)</strong> contains star-charts of the warp rift's interior (studying them: <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) WP</em> or <em>1 Insanity Point</em>) and a cogitator with navigational data (<em>Hard (&ndash;20) Forbidden Lore (Warp)</em> to interpret) revealing the rift is artificial, anchored to the Heart, Strahd's will, and Sergei's remains, and expanding toward the nearest Imperial system.</p>\n<p><strong>The South Tower</strong> is where Tatyana fell. The psychic imprint is seared into the warp-stuff: psykers must pass <em>Hard (&ndash;20) WP</em> or experience a devastating vision of Tatyana's final moments (<em>1d5 Insanity Points, 1 Corruption Point</em>), but gain understanding that may grant <em>+10</em> to social tests against Strahd.</p>\n<h3>The Crypts (Map 11d)</h3>\n<p>Beneath the Spire, a labyrinthine network of corridors and burial vaults extends far beyond the castle's footprint &mdash; a spatial impossibility enabled by the warp rift. Navigation is <em>Hard (&ndash;20)</em>. All light sources have halved range. Fear resistance suffers <em>&ndash;10</em>. Temperature is &ndash;5&deg;C (Fatigue from cold after 2 hours without gear, <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Toughness</em> per hour).</p>\n<p>Ten named crypts are detailed in the <strong>Heart and Crypts</strong> page. Of particular note: <strong>Sergei's tomb</strong> (incorrupt body, possible Dawn's Edge location, spirit offers blessing of <em>+10 WP vs. Strahd</em>), <strong>Strahd's coffin</strong> (deepest chamber, behind a false wall, guarded by six warp-thralls), <strong>Ireena's prepared crypt</strong> (empty sarcophagus with wedding veil &mdash; pure horror, no combat), and the <strong>Chained Daemon</strong> (a lesser Slaaneshi daemon offering accurate information for release at a cost of <em>2d10 Corruption Points</em>).</p>\n<p>Seven <strong>teleportation braziers</strong> form a rapid-transit network throughout the Spire (see Heart and Crypts page for details).</p>\n<h3>Heart Chamber (Map 11e)</h3>\n<p>Behind three successive warded doors, a spherical chamber thirty metres in diameter contains the <strong>Heart of the Spire</strong> &mdash; a metre-wide crystal of solidified warp energy, pulsing with Strahd's own heartbeat, suspended in crackling warp-lightning. Two bound <strong>Warp Stalkers</strong> (lesser daemons of Slaanesh) serve as eternal sentinels. The Heart's destruction is one of three conditions for permanently killing Strahd and triggers catastrophic effects: castle-wide earthquake, Strahd's frenzied response, destabilisation of the Spire's architecture, and stunned warp-touched creatures throughout the fortress. Full mechanics are detailed in the Heart and Crypts page.</p>"

His behaviour escalates across sessions in five distinct phases:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Phase</th><th>Trigger</th><th>Behaviour</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Curiosity</strong></td><td>Sessions 1&ndash;2</td><td>Watches, guides, opens and closes doors. The Dinner Invitation. Vox-messages are civil: <em>\"The library is to your left.\"</em></td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Amusement</strong></td><td>Sessions 2&ndash;3</td><td>Separates the party with architecture. Sends warp-thrall patrols to harass. Targets the weakest-willed Acolyte with whispered temptations. Manoeuvres to isolate Ireena.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Irritation</strong></td><td>Sessions 3&ndash;4</td><td>Deploys serious opposition: multiple warp-thrall squads, gargoyle-servitors, warp-anomaly traps. May attack a lone Acolyte to demonstrate power, then depart with a warning.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Fury</strong></td><td>Heart threatened or destroyed, coffin discovered, Dawn's Edge acquired</td><td>All pretence of hospitality ends. The castle becomes actively hostile. Strahd attacks directly with full capabilities. <em>\"YOU DARE?! In MY house?!\"</em></td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Desperation</strong></td><td>Heart and coffin both destroyed</td><td>Cold, lethal focus. Holds nothing in reserve. May offer to release Barovus in exchange for Ireena. If refused, fights to the death.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Strahd does not attack on first entry. He is a lord, and these are guests &mdash; uninvited, but guests. He appears for the Dinner scene, assesses the Acolytes, and offers a deal: leave Barovus and report it lost. If attacked during dinner, he vanishes without fighting back, and the silence afterward should feel like a profound mistake.</p>\n<h3>Gargoyle-Servitors</h3>\n<p>Stone constructs of adamantium endoskeleton, ceramite plating, and warp-infused rockite, indistinguishable from architectural decoration in dormant state. <em>Hard (&ndash;20) Awareness</em> or <em>Scrutiny</em> to detect. Activated by Strahd, proximity triggers, or violence against the castle. They attack in swarms of 4&ndash;6 with simple mob tactics, prioritising anyone attempting to leave.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Profile</th><th>Value</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>WS / S / T / Ag</td><td>35 / 50 (x2) / 55 (x2) / 20</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wounds / Armour</td><td>25 / AP 8 All (stone body)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Weapons</td><td>Slam: 1d10+10 I, Pen 2, Concussive (1)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Movement</td><td>2/4/6/12 (ground); 6/12/18/36 (flying)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Traits</td><td>Fear (1), Dark Sight, Unnatural Strength (x2), Unnatural Toughness (x2), Size (Hulking), Flyer (6), Machine (4)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Threat Rating</td><td>Challenging</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Swooping Attack:</strong> A charging flying Gargoyle-Servitor adds <em>+2d10</em> damage instead of the normal <em>+1d10</em>.</p>\n<h3>Malfunctioning Servitors</h3>\n<p>Centuries of warp exposure have corroded these domestic servitors into erratic, dangerous loops. They wander corridors repeating fragments of old tasks, occasionally lashing out. Roll <em>1d10</em> each turn for behaviour: 1&ndash;3 attack nearest target; 4&ndash;6 repeat last action; 7&ndash;8 wander randomly; 9&ndash;10 shut down for one round. WS 30, BS 30, S 35, T 40, Wounds 12, AP 4 body, Machine (2). Armed with integrated tools (1d10+3 R/I) and occasionally an integrated laspistol. Threat Rating: Ordinary.</p>\n<h3>Warp-Thralls</h3>\n<p>Former humans drained of psychic essence and reanimated as warp-puppets bound to Strahd's will. In dormant state they appear to be sleeping soldiers. When activated, dark vein-like warp growths split their skin, eyes turn black, and crystallised warp-energy fangs distend from their mouths. They fight with PDF squad tactics: suppressive fire, flanking, bounding overwatch.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Profile</th><th>Value</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>WS / BS / S / T / Ag</td><td>40 / 30 / 40 (x2) / 35 / 35</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wounds / Armour</td><td>18 / Body 3, Other 1 (Flak)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Weapons</td><td>Lasgun (Basic; 100m; S/3/&ndash;; 1d10+3 E); Warp-Fangs (Melee; 1d10+4 R, Pen 2, Tearing; <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Toughness</em> or 1 Fatigue)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Traits</td><td>Dark Sight, Fear (1), Regeneration (1) in the Spire, From Beyond</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Threat Rating</td><td>Challenging (12 in barracks; 24 total in Spire)</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Strahd sees through any thrall's senses as a Free Action. Destroyed permanently only by holy/sanctified weapons; otherwise they regenerate in 1d10 hours. If five or more are destroyed, survivors fall back to the crypts to defend the coffin.</p>\n<h3>The Organ Servitor</h3>\n<p>A once-talented human musician hardwired into the massive pipe organ for over two hundred years, playing the Ecclesiarchy hymn \"The Emperor's Light Endures\" on infinite loop. Biological components are sustained by nutrient feeds; cybernetic components maintained by the castle's systems. It is not hostile and cannot be reasoned with &mdash; it is less a person than a component of the instrument. The music is genuinely beautiful, even holy, and fills the entire ground level. An Acolyte who recognises the hymn (<em>Routine (+20) Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed)</em>) may find brief, unsettling comfort in it.</p>\n<h3>Cyrus Belview (Mongrelfolk Servant)</h3>\n<p>A pitiable creature found in the servant quarters &mdash; one of the castle's longer-surviving mongrelfolk attendants, kept by Strahd as a curiosity. Cyrus is grotesquely mutated but retains a childlike personality and a desperate desire to please. He can serve as an informant if the Acolytes treat him with kindness: he knows the layout of the ground level and crypts, the locations of several traps, the routines of the warp-thrall patrols, and the fact that \"the master goes to the deep room when he is hurt\" (Strahd's coffin). He is terrified of Strahd and will not act against him openly but can be persuaded to leave doors unlocked or deliver messages. A <em>Routine (+20) Fellowship</em> test earns his cooperation; cruelty sends him fleeing to alert Strahd.</p>\n<h3>Rahadin (Strahd's Seneschal)</h3>\n<p>Strahd's right-hand &mdash; an elite combatant who has served the von Zarovich household for centuries. Rahadin is utterly loyal, coldly efficient, and surrounded by a psychic aura of screaming: the death-screams of every person he has killed, echoing perpetually around him. All characters within 10 metres must pass a <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Willpower</em> test each round or suffer <em>&ndash;10 to all tests</em> from the psychic noise. He is encountered patrolling the upper levels or guarding the approach to the Heart Chamber. He does not negotiate, does not bluff, and does not retreat. He fights with twin power blades and preternatural speed. WS 60, BS 50, S 45, T 45, Ag 55, WP 50, Wounds 30, AP 5 All, twin power swords (1d10+7 E each, Pen 5, Balanced). Talents include Lightning Attack, Swift Attack, Step Aside, Counter-Attack, and Combat Master. Threat Rating: Dangerous.</p>\n<h3>Random Encounters</h3>\n<p>Roll <em>1d10</em> every hour of in-game exploration (every 30 minutes after the Heart is destroyed). Results range from warp-thrall patrols and malfunctioning servitors to warp anomalies, Strahd's taunting vox-messages, warp-vermin swarms, spirits of past victims, castle reconfigurations, a desperate thrall named Doru who retains fragments of humanity (but may revert to Strahd's control every 10 minutes &mdash; WP 25 test), and Strahd himself appearing to observe or attack depending on his current phase.</p>"

Contains Strahd's full history, pact details, and the three conditions for permanent destruction. Provides <em>+10 to all tests to resist Strahd's powers</em> and <em>+10 to Combat tests against Strahd</em> if decrypted and studied.</li>\n<li><strong>Dawn's Edge</strong> (possible Tarot-designated location: Sergei's tomb, or elsewhere): Relic power sword. 1d10+8 E, Pen 6, Power Field, Balanced, Sanctified, Proven (3). Emits 20m golden light; warp entities in the light suffer <em>&ndash;20 WP</em> and cannot regenerate. Against Strahd: additional 1d10 damage, ignores Unnatural Toughness. Requires WP 40+ and CP 30 or fewer to activate.</li>\n<li><strong>Rosette of Saint Markovia</strong> (possible Tarot-designated location): Inquisitorial rosette relic. <em>+20 WP</em> to resist psychic powers/corruption/Fear within 5m.

Once/day: <em>2d10 E, Pen 8, Sanctified</em> burst within 15m.</li>\n<li><strong>Library texts</strong> (Study bookshelves, 1 hour + <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) Scholastic Lore (Occult)</em>): <em>+20 bonus</em> to a single <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp)</em> test.</li>\n<li><strong>Audience Chamber intelligence</strong>: Centuries of governance data, including rift date (437.M39), Sergei's death warrant, confirmation of Strahd's age.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quest Connections</h3>\n<p>All three relics potentially converge in the Spire. The Emperor's Tarot reading from Act I determines where each is found &mdash; one or more may be located within the Spire itself (Dawn's Edge in Sergei's tomb, the Rosette in the crypts, the Tome in Strahd's study). The Acolytes' primary objectives within the Spire are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Recover the Tome of Strahd to learn the three conditions for permanent destruction.</li>\n<li>Destroy the Heart of the Spire (Heart Chamber, Map 11e).</li>\n<li>Find and destroy or sanctify Strahd's coffin (deepest crypt, Map 11d).</li>\n<li>Strike Strahd down with Dawn's Edge while the Rosette is active and both the Heart and coffin are neutralised.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Strahd's Tactics</h3>\n<p><strong>When he engages:</strong> Strahd singles out the most martially skilled Acolyte for duelling, uses lair actions to control the battlefield, and directs minions with <em>+10</em> to all their tests. He parries with contemptuous ease (Parry 75) and ripostes with lethal precision.</p>\n<p><strong>When he withdraws:</strong> Strahd phases through walls to reposition, retreats to his coffin to regenerate (1d10 hours, or 1d5 if the Heart is intact), and redeploys forces between forays. Each time the Acolytes re-enter the Spire, he has adapted: repositioned forces, reset traps, adjusted strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>How he uses the lair:</strong> Strahd separates the party through architecture, funnels them into ambushes, blocks escape routes, and creates environmental hazards. He extinguishes lights, seals rooms, and summons servitors at will. The castle is his weapon.</p>\n<h3>Lair Actions</h3>\n<p>Strahd may perform one Lair Action at Initiative 0 each round. These are not psychic powers &mdash; they require no test and cannot be resisted by conventional means. They are expressions of the castle as an extension of Strahd's will.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Lair Action</th><th>Effect</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Command the Castle</strong></td><td>Doors slam open/shut and lock (<em>Armour 8, SI 20</em> to force). Walls slide. Floors tilt. Staircases reverse. Can separate party members or funnel into ambushes. Once per scene or combat encounter.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Phase Through Walls</strong></td><td>Strahd passes through any solid surface in the Spire &mdash; walls, floors, ceilings, locked/warded doors. Used to appear/disappear at will and pursue through solid stone.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Summon Servitors</strong></td><td>Activate any dormant servitor, gargoyle-servitor, or warp-thrall. No limit on number activated at once, but the total is finite (~60 gargoyles, 30 domestics, 12 guards, 24 thralls).</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Extinguish Light</strong></td><td>All light sources in one room/corridor die. Unnatural darkness with physical weight. <em>Challenging (&ndash;10) WP</em> or <em>&ndash;10 to all tests</em> for 1d10 rounds. Dark Sight/preysight can see but psychic oppression remains.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>The Castle Bleeds</strong></td><td>Walls weep blood. Temperature drops 20&deg;C. Warp phenomena manifest (objects move, shadows assume shapes). <em>Routine (+20) WP</em> or <em>1 Insanity Point</em>. Occurs automatically when Heart is destroyed or Strahd takes Critical Damage.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Seal the Room</strong></td><td>All exits in one room lock with blast doors. <em>Strength &ndash;30</em> or <em>Tech-Use &ndash;20</em> to force open.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Warp Surge</strong></td><td>One room floods with warp energy. All occupants take <em>1d10 E</em> (ignoring armour) and must pass <em>WP</em> test or gain <em>1d5 Corruption Points</em>.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Phase 2+ Escalation (Strahd below 50% Wounds or Heart/coffin destroyed):</strong> Additional lair actions become available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Warp-Fire:</strong> Jets of immaterial flame from walls &mdash; 3m wide, 10m long line. <em>2d10+3 E, Pen 4, Warp Weapon. Agility Challenging (+0)</em> to avoid.</li>\n<li><strong>The Walls Close:</strong> Chamber physically contracts. All characters pushed <em>1d5m</em> toward centre. Characters pushed into walls suffer <em>1d10 I</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Floor of Madness:</strong> Floor becomes transparent, revealing raw warp beneath. <em>Challenging (+0) WP</em> or <em>1 Insanity Point</em> and Stunned 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>Douse the Lights:</strong> All artificial light dies. Only Dawn's Edge and the Rosette illuminate. Characters without Dark Sight suffer <em>&ndash;30 WS and BS</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Summon Thralls:</strong> <em>1d5</em> warp-thralls claw through walls/floor within 10m (WS 30, S 30, T 30, Wounds 8 &mdash; weak but serve as distractions).</li>\n<li><strong>The Spire Speaks:</strong> Strahd channels his voice through vox-systems. <em>Challenging (+0) WP</em> or <em>&ndash;10 to all tests</em> for 1 round as his words worm into their minds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Final Battle (Act IV Reference)</h3>\n<p>The final confrontation with Strahd is covered in full in Act IV. The battle location is determined by the Emperor's Tarot reading. Strahd fights in three phases:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Phase</th><th>Trigger</th><th>Key Changes</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Phase 1: The Lord-Governor</strong></td><td>Combat begins</td><td>WS 65, WP 70, 80 Wounds, Fear (3). Master duelist. Directs minions with tactical precision. Lair actions as above.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Phase 2: The Warp-Touched</strong></td><td>50% Wounds (40 remaining), or Heart/coffin destroyed</td><td>Fear (4). Psy Rating +2. Gains Domination, Warp Lightning, Telekinesis, Fear Aura. Phases aggressively (can negate hits 3x/combat). Escalated lair actions.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Phase 3: The Daemon Ascendant</strong></td><td>10 Wounds or fewer, coffin destroyed (optional phase)</td><td>Wounds restored to 40. Unnatural x3. Fear (5). Psy Rating 9. Daemonic trait. Loses 5 Wounds/turn (built-in 8-round timer). Daemon Prince manifests partially in the rift above.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Permanent destruction requires all three conditions simultaneously:</strong> Heart of the Spire destroyed, coffin destroyed or sanctified, and the killing blow struck by Dawn's Edge while the Rosette is active. If any condition is unmet, Strahd regenerates within 1d10 days.</p>"

The room is a sphere, thirty metres in diameter, carved from the living rock of the mountain. The walls are covered in script grown into the stone like veins in flesh, in no language any of you recognise. And at the centre of the sphere, suspended in empty air, turning slowly in a web of crackling warp-lightning, is the Heart. A crystal &mdash; a metre across, roughly spherical, translucent, pulsing with a deep arterial red light that throbs in time with a rhythm you can feel in your chest. It is, you realise with horror, a heartbeat. The castle's heartbeat. Strahd's heartbeat.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Heart of the Spire is the nexus of the warp rift's connection to the castle and, through the castle, to Strahd. It is the mechanism by which the pact's power is channelled into the physical world. Destroying it is one of the three conditions necessary to permanently kill Strahd.</p>\n<h3>The Warded Doors</h3>\n<p>Three successive doors guard the approach.

The Heart also emits a pulse of warp energy that deals <em>1d10 E damage</em> (ignoring armour) to all non-warp-touched creatures in the chamber.

Every area should feel consequential: rooms are not cleared and marked safe, they are survived. Strahd is always watching through scrying-servitors in the walls (<em>Awareness, Hard -20</em> to spot), warp-sight, and hidden passages. Track his behavioural escalation across sessions: Curious (1-2) to Amused (2-3) to Irritated (3-4) to Furious (4) to Desperate (final). The Spire is designed for 3-5 sessions of exploration. Do not let the Acolytes clear it in a single foray.</p>\n\n<h3>Road &amp; Drawbridge</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The road climbs Mount Ghakis on cracked ferrocrete switchbacks — an hour of demoralising ascent past defaced saint-statues. <em>Willpower (Routine +20)</em> on first seeing the Spire or feel a creeping sense of wrongness — being expected, walking willingly into a trap. Failure by 3+ degrees: momentary compulsion to turn back (resistible without further testing). The drawbridge spans a 90m chasm over liquefied warp-stuff (instantly fatal, <em>Very Hard -30 Willpower</em> or 1d10 CP during the fall). The bridge lowers automatically when the Acolytes approach — Strahd controls it through will alone. Wind gusts on the bridge — <em>Agility (Challenging +0)</em> or lose footing near the edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> 37 defaced saints line the road — Imperial saints with faces chiselled away, aquilas carefully inverted, prayer-scrolls re-engraved with blasphemous catechisms. <em>Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) (Challenging +0)</em> identifies several as minor Ecclesiarchy missionaries who served in the Barovus subsector. The defacement is systematic, not vandalistic — done with reverence, not rage. It is worship. One statue, better preserved: a figure in Ministorum robes whose hands have been repositioned to point accusingly toward the Spire. The last statue before the bridge is Saint Markovia — her face intact though marred. The Rosette was hers.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP from approaching the Spire — warp concentration intensifies with proximity to the rift's nexus.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The approach is theatre. Let Strahd control the drawbridge to demonstrate absolute authority — it lowers for the Acolytes when he is ready, mocking any attempt to cross by other means (grapnel, jump pack) by lowering anyway. If Strahd does not want visitors, the bridge stays up: <em>Athletics (Very Hard -30)</em> to cross the gap by other means, certain death on failure.

When triggered, swarms of 4-6 detach and attack. 4 Gargoyle-Servitors per wave (WS 35, S 40, T 45, Ag 30, 15 Wounds, AP 6 all, Flight 8, Natural Weapons: claws 1d10+4 R Pen 2, Fear 1, Machine 4, Unnatural Toughness 2). Relentless mob tactics — surround and overwhelm, prioritise anyone attempting to leave the Spire. <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3, reduce to 3 per wave. For 6+, add 2 per wave and increase to 6. Total available: 40-60 gargoyle-servitors in the Spire.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Dead gardens — not topiary sculptures but chem-treated, warp-stasis-preserved corpses of former servants, posed in attitudes of service. <em>Medicae (Ordinary +10)</em> or <em>Awareness (Ordinary +10)</em> to identify the truth. A fountain with the von Zarovich crest runs with dark liquid — <em>Medicae (Challenging +0)</em> confirms human blood, preserved by warp energy. Touching the fountain: brief psychic flash of the fountain running bright red while figures in formal dress drink from crystal goblets. Strahd's personal carriage sits beneath an awning — a bespoke tracked vehicle with a bound warp-entity replacing its machine-spirit (WP 55, obeys only Strahd).</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> 80m square kill zone overlooked by dozens of windows. The Acolytes are observed at all times. <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> detects movement behind the glass. The courtyard offers no cover against the gargoyle-servitors.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP from the blood fountain (warp-preserved organic material). 1 IP from being watched — the certainty that eyes track every movement from every window.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The courtyard is designed as a kill zone. If the gargoyle-servitors activate, the Acolytes are in the open with no cover and enemies dropping from above. Smart parties arrive by invitation — Strahd's dinner invitation or the black carriage — and bypass this entirely. That bypass is itself unsettling: the monster opened the door for you.</p>\n\n<h3>Grand Entry Hall</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Faith Test</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> A 30m-high cathedral space with black granite pillars carved with conquest scenes. The floor mosaic depicts the Emperor enthroned — but His face has been replaced with Strahd's. <em>Awareness (Ordinary +10)</em> to notice the substitution, which is done with such skill it is not immediately obvious. <em>Scholastic Lore (War) (Ordinary +10)</em> on the pillar carvings: the depicted tactics are brilliant — Strahd was a genuinely gifted commander. <em>Scholastic Lore (Occult) (Hard -20)</em>: later carvings show enemies dissolving, withering, consumed by shadow — the transition from conventional warfare to something else, documented in stone. Six chandeliers (2 tonnes each) can be dropped on enemies: <em>BS (Challenging +0)</em> to shoot through the chain, 4d10+10 I damage in 4m radius, Concussive (3).</p>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> An organ plays itself — a servitor hardwired into a massive pipe organ, playing the Imperial hymn \"The Emperor's Light Endures\" on infinite loop for 200+ years. <em>Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) (Routine +20)</em> recognises the hymn. The music is warp-resonant: <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> or be compelled to listen (1d5 rounds lost, 1 CP). <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Hard -20)</em> identifies the music as a psychic lure designed to calm intruders and lower defences. Resisting actively with prayer: <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em>, success grants +10 to WP tests for 1 hour as the Emperor's light pushes back against Strahd's domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP from the organ music (unavoidable if heard). Can be countered by faith. 1 IP from the blasphemous mosaic (<em>Willpower, Routine +20</em> to resist).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The Entry Hall sets the Spire's tone — Strahd is cultured, refined, and patient. He does not need to attack. The music does his work for him. The mosaic is a theological statement: Strahd has placed himself in the Emperor's position. Prayer is the counter to the music, and this should reinforce the campaign's central theme — faith matters mechanically and narratively on Barovus.</p>\n\n<h3>Dining Hall</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> THE Strahd scene — the Dinner Invitation. A 20m table set for exactly the party's number, each place marked with a name card in elegant script. The food is real, excellently prepared, and not poisoned — Strahd considers poisoning guests vulgar. <em>Medicae (Ordinary +10)</em> or <em>Trade (Cook) (Ordinary +10)</em> confirms safety. Eating restores 1d5 Wounds and removes 1 Fatigue. Strahd arrives not through a door but by simply being there, as though he had always been present. He is calm, articulate, and terrifyingly polite.</p>\n<p><strong>Social — Strahd's Objectives:</strong> Assess the Acolytes' strength and resolve. Identify the weakest-willed member for future corruption attempts. If Ireena is present, his attention fixes on her with intensity masked by perfect courtesy — <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> catches the mask slipping when he calls her \"Tatyana\" and catches himself. He offers a deal: leave Barovus, report the world as lost, and he permits departure. He is sincere. If refused, he is disappointed, not angry: <em>\"A pity. I had hoped you would be reasonable.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Social — Information Gathering:</strong> <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> to remember this is a monster while enjoying his hospitality. <em>Charm/Deceive (Very Hard -30)</em> to gain information from Strahd without revealing plans. He freely admits his age, his rule, the rift's origin. He will not discuss the pact's terms, the Heart, or Dawn's Edge — these topics are deflected with four centuries of practiced authority.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 2 CP from prolonged proximity to Strahd — the most powerful warp-touched entity on Barovus, at arm's length, pouring wine. 1d5 IP from the cognitive dissonance of dining with a monster who is genuinely pleasant. Reference Interrogator Vasek's confession: <em>\"He was civilised. Charming. He asked about my homeworld...\"</em> The Acolytes are experiencing exactly what corrupted an Inquisitor.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the single most important scene in the Spire. Play Strahd at his absolute best — compelling, human, and terrifying in equal measure. The food is good. The conversation is fascinating. The wine is superb. The horror is how EASY it is to forget what he is. If the Acolytes attack during dinner, Strahd simply vanishes with weary disappointment. The food remains. The candles burn. The silence accuses. Make this feel like a mistake — not through punishment, but through the profound discomfort of the aftermath.</p>\n\n<h3>Audience Chamber</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Combat, Investigation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> 12 Servitor-Guards in dormant mode around the throne dais — activate if anyone sits on the throne or by Strahd's command. Servitor-Guards (WS 40, BS 35, S 45 Unnatural Strength x2, T 40, Ag 20, 20 Wounds, AP 5 all, Machine 3). Armed with built-in lascarbines (75m, S/2/-, 1d10+3 E, Reliable) and power mauls (1d10+6 E, Pen 4, Power Field, Shocking). Fight without tactics or self-preservation. <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3, reduce to 8 active (others remain dormant). For 6+, all 12 activate simultaneously and Strahd commands coordinated tactics (+10 to tests).</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> Centuries of governance records in crystal data-slate racks. <em>Inquiry (Challenging +0)</em> or <em>Scholastic Lore (Administratum) (Challenging +0)</em> (requires 1+ hour of searching): the exact date the warp rift closed (437.M39), records of mass disappearances and psychic phenomena immediately after, citizen petitions for Imperial rescue stamped \"RECEIVED — NO ACTION REQUIRED\" in Strahd's handwriting, and a death warrant for Sergei von Zarovich signed by Strahd on the day of Sergei's wedding. A pattern emerges: early records show a just if stern ruler; later records show increasing paranoia, cruelty, and references to \"the unworthy.\" The descent is documented.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Hidden passage behind the throne leads to the chapel and study. <em>Awareness (Very Hard -30)</em> or <em>Search (Hard -20)</em> to locate. A sufficiently bold Acolyte who sits on the throne may attempt <em>Willpower (Very Hard -30)</em>: success grants a disorienting vision of the Spire's layout from Strahd's perspective — revealing artifact locations, the Heart, and the coffin. Failure: 2d10 CP and Strahd's immediate hostile attention.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The servitors only attack if the Acolytes threaten the space or Strahd commands it. If the party are \"guests,\" they can explore freely — Strahd's confidence is absolute. The data-slates are a goldmine for investigation-focused players. The throne gambit is high-risk, high-reward — advertise the danger through atmosphere (the warpstone surface shifting with half-seen faces) but let brave players attempt it.</p>\n\n<h3>Chapel</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Faith Test, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> Sanctified ground — the only true safe space in the Spire. Despite centuries of desecration, the original consecration holds. The Emperor's light flickers here: a single candle burns without fuel in a saint's alcove, inextinguishable by any means. <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> to pray at the altar — success: vision of the chapel as it once was (bright, clean, singing voices, golden aquila), removes 1d5 IP and restores 1d5 Wounds (once per Acolyte). Warp entities (including Strahd) find the chapel uncomfortable — Strahd can enter but avoids it. All tests to resist his lair actions gain +10 here. Faith and Emperor-aligned psychic powers function at +10. Corruption tests gain +20 bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Saint Markovia's personal effects — journals, prayer books, the altar she prayed at. <em>Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) (Challenging +0)</em> confirms these are genuine relics. If the Rosette of Saint Markovia is placed on this altar, it fully charges to maximum power for the final confrontation. If Dawn's Edge is brought here, it blazes with golden fire and gains the Sanctified quality permanently (if not already possessed).</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> None — the chapel REMOVES CP and IP. -1d5 CP for entering and praying (minimum 0). A genuine sanctuary in the heart of the monster's lair.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The chapel is a strategic rest point and should feel like finding breathable air underwater. Strahd HATES it — he cannot destroy it, and its existence mocks him. If the Acolytes fortify here, Strahd tries to lure them out (temptation, threats, staging attacks on allies elsewhere) but will not breach the sanctified ground. This is also the optimal location for reconsecration during the final battle — if performed (<em>3 Full Actions, Hard -20 Willpower each round, requires Rosette</em>), Strahd suffers 3d10 E damage (Pen all, Sanctified) and -20 to all tests while in the chapel.</p>\n\n<h3>Strahd's Study</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Investigation, Discovery, Trap</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> The Tome of Strahd — an ancient, ornate data-cogitator containing 400 years of encrypted High Gothic diary entries. <em>Tech-Use (Hard -20)</em> or <em>Ciphers (Imperial Codes) (Hard -20)</em> to decrypt (failure locks the device for 1d10 hours). Contents: Strahd's complete history, the pact with Daemon Prince Tenebrous, his murder of Sergei on the wedding day, the reincarnation cycle, and the three conditions for permanent destruction (Heart destroyed + coffin neutralised + struck down by Dawn's Edge). Also reveals vulnerabilities: blessed silver (+2 damage), the Hymn of the Golden Throne (forces <em>WP (Challenging +0)</em> or -10 to all tests for 1 round), Sergei's personal effects (each forces WP test or lose next turn). Reading the Tome grants all who study it: +10 to resist Strahd's psychic powers, +10 to combat tests against Strahd, and +10 to fear effects — detailed knowledge of his fighting style, habits, and patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Trap:</strong> The Tome is warded. <em>Psyniscience (Hard -20)</em> to detect the ward before contact. Touching without dispelling: 2d10 E damage + 1d10 CP (psychic feedback of 300 years of compressed rage). <em>Willpower (Very Hard -30)</em> to dispel the ward psychically, or <em>Tech-Use (Hard -20)</em> to physically bypass by disconnecting the ward circuit.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Strahd's personal effects throughout the study — star-charts, coded correspondence with the Daemon Prince, and portraits of every Tatyana reincarnation spanning centuries, each painted with devastating skill. The portraits show awareness — Strahd KNOWS about the reincarnation cycle and chooses to pursue each incarnation anyway. The study is warm — a fireplace with actual logs, a half-finished glass of wine, a portrait of Sergei above the mantle. The most human space in the Spire.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 2 CP from handling the Tome (unavoidable warp residue). 1d10 IP from reading it — 300 years of horror, obsession, and self-aware damnation compressed into one session. The +10 bonuses against Strahd are worth the cost.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The Study is a treasure trove and a trap. The Tome is the most important item in the room — it transforms the final battle from a slugfest into a strategic operation. But every other discovery adds depth. The portraits are particularly haunting: dozens of women, spanning centuries, all with Ireena's face. The scattered diary entries of self-awareness — moments where the man Strahd used to be surfaces in shaky handwriting — should be the most disturbing thing in the Spire. He knows. He has always known.</p>\n\n<h3>Organ Loft</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Skill Challenge, Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The organ from the Entry Hall extends here — massive pipes of blackened metal, the music louder and more insistent. The servitor-organist is hardwired to the console, playing for 200+ years, biological components sustained by nutrient feeds. <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> each round or be compelled to play. If played: <em>Perform/Trade (Musician) (Challenging +0)</em> — playing feeds warp energy into the Spire, 1 CP per round to all within earshot. The organ is a psychic amplifier — its acoustic properties channel and distort psychic resonance throughout the Spire.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> <em>Tech-Use (Hard -20)</em> to disable the organ's warp-resonance mechanism. Requires access to internal workings — <em>Athletics (Challenging +0)</em> to climb into the pipe structure. Disabling the organ removes the compulsion effect throughout the Spire and eliminates one of Strahd's lair actions (\"The Spire Speaks\") from the final battle. Alternatively, playing an Imperial hymn: the castle shudders, warp-thralls within earshot are Stunned for 1 round, and Strahd suffers -10 to all tests for 1d5 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Inside the organ — a crystallised psychic node amplifying Strahd's psychic powers within the Spire. <em>Psyniscience (Hard -20)</em> to identify. Destroying it (S 40+ melee hit or psychic attack): -10 to Strahd's WP for the final battle — a permanent, stacking tactical advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The organ is optional but highly tactical. Disabling the resonance mechanism AND destroying the psychic node before the final battle removes a lair action AND weakens Strahd's WP. Players who explore thoroughly are rewarded with meaningful mechanical advantages. Playing a discordant or chaotic piece is dangerous — warp energy surges, everyone tests <em>WP (Challenging +0)</em> or gains 1d5 CP, and the castle's geometry destabilises further.</p>\n\n<h3>Towers</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Discovery, Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental — North Tower (Observatory):</strong> Structurally unsound. <em>Awareness (Challenging +0)</em> to notice signs of instability. Entering without caution: <em>Agility (Hard -20)</em> or partial collapse — 3d10 I damage and trapped in rubble. Contains star-charts and cogitator console. <em>Tech-Use (Challenging +0)</em> to activate the cogitator: navigational data showing the warp rift's interior topology. <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Hard -20)</em> to interpret: the rift is artificial (created by the pact), anchored to three points (Heart, Strahd's will, Sergei's remains), and slowly expanding — will engulf the nearest inhabited Imperial system in approximately 200 years. This transforms the mission from liberation to subsector-wide strategic priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental — South Tower (Sergei's Tower):</strong> Empty — bare stone spiralling to an open platform. The parapet is broken on one side, torn outward. This is where Tatyana fell. Any psyker entering must pass <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or be overwhelmed by a vision of Tatyana's final moments — her terror, Strahd reaching for her, her expression shifting from terror to pity: <em>\"You are already dead.\"</em> Then she falls. Non-psykers feel only a profound, inexplicable sadness.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The towers contain Strahd's collections — art, artefacts, trophies from centuries. <em>Awareness (Hard -20)</em> in one tower reveals Strahd's personal armoury — Dawn's Edge is NOT here, but its empty display case is, with a plaque: <em>\"Dawn's Edge — let the unworthy never touch it again.\"</em> A taunt and a clue: the sword is elsewhere in the world, not the Spire.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP per tower explored (ambient warp). 1d5 IP + 1 CP from the South Tower vision (raw warp-emotional resonance of Tatyana's death). The South Tower vision also grants a potential +10 bonus to social tests against Strahd (GM discretion) — understanding the monster's grief makes him easier to predict.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The towers are exploration content — no mandatory encounters, but rich discoveries. The Observatory data is strategically critical (subsector-level threat), the South Tower is emotionally devastating (Tatyana's last moments), and the armoury is a deliberate misdirection (Dawn's Edge is NOT here). Let investigation-focused players mine these for every advantage. The structural instability of the North Tower is a genuine hazard — describe groaning stone and shifting floors before the Agility test.</p>\n\n<h3>Crypts</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Deadly</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Combat, Discovery, Trap, Faith Test</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Labyrinthine network significantly larger than the castle above — spatial impossibility enabled by the warp rift. <em>Navigate (Hard -20)</em> to avoid becoming lost. All light sources halved range. All WP tests to resist Fear suffer -10. Temperature: -5C, <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> per hour without cold gear or gain Fatigue.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> 10 named crypts with varied inhabitants. Servitor crypts contain 2-4 combat servitors each, activated by intrusion. Total possible across all crypts: 12 Servitor-Guards + 6 Warp-Thralls. The party will not fight all at once unless they clear every crypt systematically. Per-crypt: <strong>Scaling:</strong> Reduce by 1 for 3, add 1 for 6+. Special threats: General Grislek's revenant (Crypt 6: WS 50, S 45 USx2, T 40, 25 Wounds, AP 4, power sword + bolt pistol — attacks immediately, cannot be reasoned with). Ludmilla's crypt (Crypt 7: appears to negotiate but IS the daemon — freeing her releases a Daemonette of Slaanesh with +10 to all characteristics).</p>\n<p><strong>Traps:</strong> Teleportation traps in 3 crypts. <em>Awareness (Hard -20)</em> to detect. Triggering teleports the victim to a random Spire location (including OUTSIDE on a ledge). <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> to resist. 1d5 CP per teleportation from brief warp transit. The False Crypt of Saint Markovia (Crypt 8) scatters the entire party — each Acolyte tests <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> or is teleported individually to different Spire locations. Those who resist: 2d10 E damage from discharged warp energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> Sergei's crypt is sealed with sanctified wards (golden light). <em>Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) (Ordinary +10)</em> to open with prayer, or brute force (Armour 12, SI 30 — forcing the seal: 2d10 E burst to warp-touched creatures within 5m). Sergei's body is incorrupt — 400 years dead and appears merely sleeping. His spirit manifests: blessing grants +10 WP vs Strahd's abilities for the remainder of the campaign. He confirms the three destruction conditions. If Ireena touches his locket, a moment of peace. King Barov's crypt: his spirit answers questions about Strahd with imperious shame. Queen Ravenovia's crypt: she weeps and reveals the coffin is behind a false wall marked with the family crest.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Ireena's prepared crypt (Crypt 5) — empty sarcophagus marked \"IREENA KOLYANA — BELOVED\" with blank dates and a folded wedding veil inside. No encounter. No trap. Just horror. If Ireena is present: <em>WP (Hard -20)</em> or Stunned 1d5 rounds. All other Acolytes: 1 IP. The Chained Daemon (Crypt 9): a lesser Slaaneshi daemon imprisoned by Strahd for a century, bound in blessed adamantium. Knows the complete crypt layout, coffin location, Heart weaknesses, and teleportation brazier command words. Offers this freely for release. It is telling the truth. Releasing it: <em>Forbidden Lore (Daemonology) (Hard -20)</em> and 2d10 CP. The freed daemon flees the Spire entirely. Tomb of the Forgotten (Crypt 10): mass grave of Strahd's victims — men, women, children. No encounter. 1 IP from finding a child's toy or an unsent letter among the bones.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 2 CP per crypt entered (ambient). +1d5 CP in warp-thrall crypts. Sergei's crypt reduces IP (a sanctuary within the nightmare). Teleportation braziers throughout the crypts: <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Hard -20)</em> or <em>Tech-Use (Hard -20)</em> to activate, <em>WP (Challenging +0)</em> or 1d5 CP per use. Seven braziers connect: crypt entrance, study, Heart chamber, courtyard, north tower, chapel, and coffin chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The crypts are a dungeon within a dungeon. They should be explored methodically, not rushed — each crypt tells a story. Sergei's crypt is the emotional core: save it for a dramatic moment. Ireena's empty tomb should silence the table. The Chained Daemon is the crypts' moral dilemma — genuine, useful intelligence at genuine spiritual cost. Ludmilla (Crypt 7) is a deliberate betrayal to punish trust — after the daemon offered truth, Ludmilla offers lies. Vary the rhythm: quiet horror, then combat, then moral choice, then quiet horror again.</p>\n\n<h3>Heart Chamber</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Catastrophic</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Combat, Skill Challenge, Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> The Heart of the Spire — a crystallised warp entity, 1m across, pulsing arterial red, suspended in warp-lightning at the chamber's centre. Guarded by 2 Warp Stalkers (lesser Slaaneshi daemons, chained to the chamber walls, freed when anyone enters without Strahd's permission). Heart profile: Armour 8 (warp-infused crystal), SI 50, Immune to non-physical damage, half damage from energy weapons, full damage from Sanctified/Holy/faith-powered weapons, DOUBLE damage from Dawn's Edge. While the Heart exists: Strahd benefits from Regeneration (5) — heals 5 Wounds per turn. The chamber contains 5 conduits connecting the Heart to the Spire's power grid. Each conduit destroyed (S 30+ hit) reduces Regeneration by 2. <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3, reduce to 1 Warp Stalker and SI to 40. For 6+, add 1 Warp Stalker and increase SI to 60.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> <em>Tech-Use (Very Hard -30)</em> to sever the Heart's connection to the Spire's power grid, reducing SI by 15. <em>Psyniscience (Hard -20)</em> to identify the optimal conduit destruction sequence (most efficient order, reducing Regeneration fastest). The 5-conduit mechanic rewards tactical play over brute force.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The Heart pulses raw warp energy — <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> each round or 1 CP + 1d5 IP. Three successive warded doors guard the approach: each requires <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Challenging +0)</em> or <em>Security (Challenging +0)</em> to open (or Armour 10, SI 35 per door). The wards inflict 2d10 E (Pen 5, ignoring non-psychic armour) to any warp-touched entity passing through — warp-thralls and servitors CANNOT follow the Acolytes here.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 3 CP per round in the chamber. 1d10 IP on first seeing the Heart — it is alive, it is screaming, it has been screaming for 300 years. Destroying it: everyone tests <em>Willpower (Very Hard -30)</em> or gains 1d10 CP + 1d10 IP as the warp rushes in. Strahd screams (1d5 IP, no save, castle-wide). The chamber becomes unstable — 15% chance per round of wall collapse (2d10+5 E from warp exposure within 5m). Approximately 10 rounds before the chamber is unsurvivable.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Destroying the Heart is one of three conditions for killing Strahd. Without it, he regenerates indefinitely. The Heart should feel like a living thing in pain — this is horror, not a health bar. Describe the rhythmic pulsing that matches the Acolytes' heartbeats, the screaming that has echoed for centuries, the way the crystal weeps luminous tears of warp-stuff. Post-destruction: the entire Spire shakes, Strahd becomes Frenzied and moves immediately toward this chamber, warp-touched creatures are Stunned 1d5 rounds, and Navigation tests worsen by -10. The Acolytes should feel the castle dying around them.</p>\n\n<h3>Strahd's Coffin</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Deadly</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Combat, Investigation</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Investigation:</strong> The deepest crypt, behind a false wall marked with the von Zarovich crest. <em>Navigate (Very Hard -30)</em> or <em>Search (Hard -20)</em> to find without guidance. Queen Ravenovia's spirit provides directions (+20). The partial Spire map from Van Richten's data-slate provides +10. The coffin: masterwork dark wood and adamantium banding, crimson silk lining, hexagrammic wards of preservation. Radiates a faint psychic pulse like vast, sleeping breath.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation — Destroying the Coffin:</strong> Armour 8, immune to warp and psychic damage. Requires 30 damage to destroy, OR the Rosette of Saint Markovia held against it for 3 consecutive rounds (<em>WP (Challenging +0)</em> each round to maintain contact as the coffin shrieks and lashes out: 1d10+3 E, Pen 4 to the bearer per round). Takes double damage from Sanctified weapons. Alternatively, sanctification ritual: <em>Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) (Very Hard -30)</em> + 3 rounds of consecration while the coffin is exposed to the Rosette or Dawn's Edge. Sanctification does not destroy the coffin but renders it useless — Strahd can no longer regenerate within it.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> 6 Warp-Thralls standing guard (WS 40, BS 30, S 40 USx2, T 35, Ag 35, 18 Wounds, AP Body 3/Other 1, lasguns + warp-fangs: 1d10+4 R Pen 2 Tearing, bite drains 1 Fatigue on failed <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em>, Fear 1, Regeneration 1 within Spire). If Strahd is aware of the intrusion, he arrives within 2d10 rounds via teleportation brazier. If the final confrontation occurs here: Strahd at full profile — WS 65, BS 55, S 55 USx2, T 50 UTx2 (+4 if Heart intact), Ag 60, WP 70, 80 Wounds, Psy Rating 5, Fear 3, Regeneration 1d10/round (if Heart intact), Phase, Stuff of Nightmares, AP 6 all. Armed with corrupted power sword (1d10+12 E Pen 7 Warp Weapon), bolt pistol with warp-tainted rounds (1d10+7 X Pen 5 Tearing Warp Weapon), and Drain touch (1d10+10 R Pen 2, heals Strahd equal to damage dealt on failed <em>Toughness, Challenging +0</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Scaling:</strong> Strahd himself does not scale — he is a fixed threat. The environment scales: for 3, remove 2 warp-thrall guards. For 6+, Strahd summons 4 additional Warp-Thralls at 50% health. Three combat phases: Phase 1 (Lord-Governor, above 40 Wounds) — tactical duelist with lair actions; Phase 2 (Warp-Touched, below 40 Wounds) — mutations manifest, Fear 4, Psy Rating 7, Phase used aggressively, new lair actions (Warp-Fire, Walls Close, Floor of Madness); Phase 3 (Daemon Ascendant, below 10 Wounds with coffin destroyed) — optional, daemonic avatar, Fear 5, Psy Rating 9, Daemonic trait, Unnatural x3, BUT loses 5 Wounds per turn (built-in 8-round timer). Phase 3 does NOT occur if Ireena has sacrificed herself.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 5 CP from the final confrontation (unavoidable — the nexus of the warp rift, a 400-year-old monster fighting for its existence, and the raw power of a Daemon Prince pouring through the Spire). Additional CP/IP depend on combat phase, lair actions, and outcome. Witnessing Phase 3: <em>WP (Hard -20)</em> or 1d5 CP from the Daemon Prince's offers. Strahd's death: a moment of silence — the castle shakes, the rift responds, and the campaign's resolution begins.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> This is the end. Strahd should fight with everything — lair actions, psychic powers, environmental manipulation, summoned minions. But he should also TALK. He has been waiting for this. He wants to know if they are worthy. In Phase 1, he is performing. In Phase 2, the mask is gone and the monster is revealed. In Phase 3 (if triggered), the Daemon Prince speaks through him — but at key moments (when struck by Dawn's Edge, when he sees Ireena, when an Acolyte speaks Sergei's name), Strahd himself surfaces: <em>\"Kill... me. Before it... takes everything.\"</em> If the Acolytes have all three relics and the Heart is destroyed, he knows he can die — and part of him is relieved. The tragedy of Strahd is that he wants it to end but cannot stop fighting. Let the final moment breathe. When he falls, describe not fire and fury but quiet dissolution — ash, like the last ember of a fire that burned too long. Then the castle begins to shake.</p>"

They are suggestions, scratched into mud and gravel by centuries of cart tracks and desperate feet. They do not go where you expect. They do not take as long as they should. And they are never, ever safe.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are no functional ground vehicles on Barovus. The promethium reserves ran dry generations ago, the machine spirits of the remaining transports long since fled or gone mad, and the warp-fog corrodes engine components with a thoroughness that would impress even a Mechanicus reclamation team. Travel is conducted on foot, by beast-drawn cart, or — for those fortunate or desperate enough to secure passage — aboard a Vostra caravan. Distances are measured in hours, not kilometres, because the warp-fog distorts spatial perception in ways that make cartography an exercise in futility. A road that took four hours yesterday may take six today and two tomorrow. The landscape does not change. Your perception of it does.</p>\n<p>Travel between locations is measured in abstract <strong>travel segments</strong>. Each segment represents roughly four to six hours of movement on foot. The Game Master determines the number of segments between locations based on narrative pacing, but the route descriptions on the following page provide baseline distances. For each travel segment, the GM should: <strong>(1)</strong> describe the environment — the fog, the silence, the wrongness; <strong>(2)</strong> call for a Navigation Test; and <strong>(3)</strong> roll for Random Encounters (once per segment by day, twice by night).</p>\n\n<h2>Travel Rules Summary</h2>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Condition</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Base travel speed</td><td>4 hours between adjacent locations (on road)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Off-road travel</td><td>6–8 hours, <em>Navigate (Challenging +0)</em> required</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Forced march</td><td>-2 hours but <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> or 1 Fatigue</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Night travel</td><td>Double encounter chance, -20 to <em>Navigate</em></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Warp-fog (thick)</td><td>Visibility 10m, -20 to all Perception tests, +1 CP per hour</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Storm</td><td><em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> per hour or 1 Fatigue, -30 to ranged attacks</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Rations</td><td>1 ration per person per day.

The world's sun — if it can even be called that through the perpetual haze — rises weakly and sets early. Days are grey and muted. Nights are absolute.</p>\n<p><strong>Daytime (approximately 10 hours):</strong> The fog is present but thinner. Warp phenomena are reduced. Most hostile creatures are dormant or weakened. Travel is merely dangerous.</p>\n<p><strong>Nighttime (approximately 14 hours):</strong> The fog thickens to near-opacity. Warp activity surges. All warp-touched creatures gain +10 to combat characteristics. Psychic powers are easier to manifest but harder to control (reduce Threshold by 1, but Psychic Phenomena occur on any doubles). The dead walk more freely. Strahd is at his most powerful.</p>\n<p><strong>The Witching Hour (approximately 02:00–04:00 local):</strong> The barriers between the materium and the immaterium are at their thinnest. All Corruption and Insanity Tests suffer -10. Psykers must pass a <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> Test each hour or manifest uncontrolled minor phenomena. The fog occasionally parts, revealing brief glimpses of the true warp beyond — 1d5 IP for any who witness it without averting their eyes (<em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> to look away in time).</p>\n\n<h2>The Vostra</h2>\n<p>Vostra caravans travel the roads regularly — convoys of 2d5 wagons, their void-shield-equipped transports humming through the fog like Imperial prayer-beads clicking through nervous fingers. They are the safest way to travel. Strahd's creatures avoid them, usually — a courtesy extended by the Lord-Governor himself, for reasons even the Vostra do not fully understand. Hiring Vostra escort requires a <em>Commerce (Challenging +0)</em> Test or a favour owed. They know every route and its dangers. They know which roads the wolves hunt at which hours. They know where the fog thickens and where it thins. They know these things because they have been walking these roads for three centuries, and they are still alive, which on Barovus is the highest credential anyone can offer.</p>\n<p>Vostra safe passage negates one Random Encounter roll per travel segment and grants +20 to Navigate tests. The Vostra will not, however, escort the Acolytes to the Empyrean Vault, the Warp Nexus, or Berez. Some roads even the Vostra will not walk.</p>\n\n<h2>Strahd's Surveillance</h2>\n<p>Strahd is always aware of the Acolytes' location when they travel the roads. His surveillance network is comprehensive and layered: bat-servitors (aerial reconnaissance, nearly silent, equipped with pict-recorders), wolf-packs (ground-level tracking, psychically linked to Strahd's awareness), and informant villagers (every settlement has eyes that report to the Spire). <em>Awareness (Hard -20)</em> to detect surveillance. Evading it entirely is nearly impossible, but <em>Stealth (Very Hard -30)</em> allows 1d5 hours of unobserved travel — enough to make a detour, set an ambush, or reach a location without Strahd knowing the exact route taken.</p>\n<p>The surveillance is not a punishment. It is theatre. Strahd <em>wants</em> the Acolytes to know they are watched. He wants them to feel the weight of his attention on their backs as they walk his roads. He wants them to understand that every step they take is taken because he permits it. The wolves that shadow the treeline, the servitor-skull that hovers just at the edge of visibility, the villager who watches from a window and then hurries inside — these are not threats. They are reminders. <em>You are in my house. You walk my halls. And I am always, always watching.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Resupply on the Road</h2>\n<p>Travel consumes resources. Each Acolyte requires 1 ration pack per day of travel. Failure to eat results in 1 cumulative Fatigue per day without food. Water is generally available (Barovus has abundant, if foul-tasting, surface water), but purification is recommended — untreated water requires a <em>Toughness (Routine +20)</em> Test or causes 1 Fatigue from intestinal distress.</p>\n<p>Ammunition expenditure during travel encounters should be tracked. The GM should remind players that every bolt round and lasgun charge pack spent on the road is one fewer available for the Spire. Scarcity is the campaign's silent antagonist — Strahd is patient, the warp is eternal, but the Acolytes' supplies are finite.</p>"

Each entry provides distance, terrain, hazards, and atmospheric detail. The GM should use these descriptions to narrate travel — not as scripts, but as frameworks for building tension, pacing encounters, and establishing the oppressive atmosphere that defines overworld movement on this cursed world.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Barovus to Fortress Vallak — The Main Road</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Distance</strong></td><td>3 segments (~12–18 hours on foot)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Terrain</strong></td><td>Managed forest, cracked arterial road</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk Level</strong></td><td>Tense — the most \"maintained\" route on the planet</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Navigation</strong></td><td><em>Navigate (Ordinary +10)</em> — road markers assist</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The main arterial road between the Village of Barovus and Fortress Vallak is the closest thing to a highway that exists on this world. It was once a proper Imperial transit corridor — six metres wide, surfaced with rockcrete, bordered by drainage channels and illuminated by solar-charged lumen-posts. Three centuries of neglect have reduced it to a cracked, root-buckled path through dense, grey forest, but its bones remain visible. The drainage channels are clogged with leaf-mould and something that might be organic. The lumen-posts stand at intervals like the skeletons of sentries, their solar cells dead, their housings colonised by pale fungal growths that glow faintly at night.</p>\n<p>Road markers appear every kilometre — stone pillars bearing distance measurements, directional arrows, and prayer inscriptions in faded High Gothic. Some are intact. Some have been defaced — scratched over with crude symbols, smeared with substances best left unidentified, or simply toppled. Each marker bears a prayer: the first, near Barovus, reads <em>\"The Emperor Protects.\"</em> The prayers become more desperate as the journey progresses. By the halfway point, they read <em>\"The Emperor Watches\"</em> and <em>\"The Emperor Remembers.\"</em> The final marker before Fortress Vallak reads: <em>\"HOPE IS A LIE. ENDURE.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) (Ordinary +10)</em> to identify the prayer sequence as a degraded form of the Litany of Endurance — a prayer specifically composed for soldiers on garrison duty in hostile environments. Whoever carved these markers was trained by the Ministorum, and they were losing faith in real time.</p>\n<p>The warp-fog varies along this route from light (no effect, visibility adequate) to thick (visibility 10m, -20 Perception, +1 CP per hour of exposure). There is no predicting the density — it shifts without cause, thickening in hollows and thinning on rises, sometimes parting entirely to reveal a sky the colour of a bruise before closing again like a wound sealing.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Fortress Vallak to Krezk — The Mountain Road</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Distance</strong></td><td>2 segments (~8–12 hours on foot)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Terrain</strong></td><td>Ascending mountain road, exposed switchbacks</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk Level</strong></td><td>Dangerous — exposure, cold, predators at altitude</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Navigation</strong></td><td><em>Navigate (Challenging +0)</em> — road forks, dead ends</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The mountain road to Krezk climbs steadily from the moment it leaves Fortress Vallak's western gate. The first hour is deceptive — gentle inclines through thinning forest, the road still recognisable as an Imperial construction, guard posts visible at intervals (all abandoned, some burned, one containing a skeleton in PDF uniform still seated at its desk with a half-written report crumbling in its fingers). Then the treeline ends, and the road becomes something else entirely.</p>\n<p>Above the treeline, the wind strips away all pretence of shelter. The temperature drops markedly — after hour 3, <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> per hour or suffer 1d10 E damage (cold, reduced by cold-weather gear). The road narrows to switchbacks carved into the mountainside, with sheer drops on one side and unstable rock faces on the other. Visibility decreases as altitude increases — the warp-fog is thinner here but replaced by mountain cloud and driving sleet. The road forks multiple times; some forks lead to dead ends, others to cliff edges. <em>Navigate (Challenging +0)</em> at each fork or waste 1d5 hours on a wrong turn. <em>Survival (Hard -20)</em> to find emergency shelter if weather turns violent.</p>\n<p>Warp-wolves hunt above the treeline — 50% chance of a pack encounter per hour after hour 4. The wolves at altitude are leaner, faster, and more desperate than their lowland cousins. The views, when the cloud parts, are extraordinary: the entire domain of Barovus spread below, the warp-fog visible as a solid boundary at the world's edge — a wall of writhing, luminescent mist that extends from ground level to the upper atmosphere, enclosing everything. From this altitude, the prison is visible. The sight costs 1 IP the first time it is witnessed.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Fortress Vallak to the Recaf Distillery — The Vineyard Road</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Distance</strong></td><td>1 segment (~3–4 hours on foot)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Terrain</strong></td><td>Cultivated lowland, vineyard terraces</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk Level</strong></td><td>Tranquil/Tense — the safest route on Barovus</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Navigation</strong></td><td><em>Navigate (Routine +20)</em> — well-trodden, marked</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The Vineyard Road is an anomaly. It is short, relatively well-maintained, and frequented by Vostra caravans hauling recaf and supplies between the distillery and Fortress Vallak. The road passes through what were once extensive recaf vineyards — hectares of terraced hillside that still produce a thin, bitter crop tended by frightened farmers who emerge at dawn and retreat behind locked doors well before dusk. The fields are not healthy — the soil is warp-tainted, the plants grow in colours that are not quite right — but they grow. On Barovus, that qualifies as a miracle.</p>\n<p><em>Survival (Ordinary +10)</em> reveals something curious: the recaf plants seem to purify the soil around them. Patches of earth near the plants are measurably less warp-saturated than the surrounding ground. <em>Forbidden Lore (Warp) (Hard -20)</em> or <em>Psyniscience (Challenging +0)</em> confirms it — the sacred seeds in the distillery's vault radiate a subtle anti-corruption field that extends across the vineyard. This is why the road feels different. This is why the fog is thinner here. This is why, for three blessed hours, the Acolytes might almost feel safe.</p>\n<p>Something should feel wrong about how safe it is. The GM should play this road as a reprieve — but an unsettling one. The farmers wave but do not speak. The Vostra caravans pass with nods and half-smiles. The warp-wolves do not howl here. The silence is not the silence of danger but the silence of a held breath, as if the entire road is aware that its safety exists at someone's pleasure, and that pleasure could be revoked at any moment.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Fortress Vallak to Berez — The Swamp Tracks</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Distance</strong></td><td>2 segments (~8–12 hours on foot)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Terrain</strong></td><td>Degrading road to swamp, then trackless marsh</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk Level</strong></td><td>Dangerous — environmental attrition, navigation essential</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Navigation</strong></td><td><em>Navigate (Hard -20)</em> after the road ends</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The road to Berez begins as a road and ends as a memory. The first hour follows a secondary Imperial track — narrow, poorly maintained, but passable. By hour 2, the track has softened to mud. By hour 3, the mud has become standing water. By hour 4, the road is gone entirely, swallowed by the swamp that was once the River Berez's flood plain and is now a permanent toxic marshland created by Strahd's psychic rage two centuries past.</p>\n<p>After the road ends: knee-deep water, <em>Agility (Challenging +0, -10 for heavy armour)</em> each hour or fall prone. Leeches: <em>Toughness (Ordinary +10)</em> or 1d5 R damage (blood drain) per hour. Toxic fumes after hour 4: <em>Toughness (Hard -20)</em> or 1 Fatigue (rebreathers negate this). <em>Navigate (Hard -20)</em> required every hour — failure means 1d5 hours lost circling through identical-looking reed beds and half-submerged ruins. Critical failure leads into quicksand: <em>Athletics (Hard -20)</em> to escape or sink — suffocation after 3 rounds.</p>\n<p>Nobody travels to Berez willingly. The locals speak of it in whispers, if they speak of it at all. The Vostra refuse to guide anyone there — not for any price, not for any favour. The swamp is not merely dangerous. It is grieving. It is the grave of an entire community drowned by a lovesick monster, and the water remembers. At night, the phosphorescent glow of warp-saturated water illuminates the underside of the fog, and shapes wade through the shallows — plague revenants that were once the villagers of Berez, still walking their drowned streets, still trying to go home.</p>\n\n<h3>5. To the Empyrean Vault — The Mountain Passes</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Distance</strong></td><td>4 segments (~16–24 hours from Krezk)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Terrain</strong></td><td>High altitude mountain passes, lethal cold</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk Level</strong></td><td>Deadly — the most dangerous non-combat route on Barovus</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Navigation</strong></td><td><em>Navigate (Very Hard -30)</em>, -10 without intelligence, +20 if Kasimir guides</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The mountain passes leading to the Empyrean Vault are not a road. They are a gauntlet. The route climbs beyond the Krezk plateau into the high peaks where the air thins, the cold intensifies past the point of mere discomfort into genuine lethality, and the warp bleeds through the weakened veil with increasing ferocity. This is a survival expedition, not a journey. Supply management, Fatigue tracking, and cold damage create genuine attrition before the Acolytes reach their destination.</p>\n<p>Above 3000m: lethal cold. <em>Toughness (Hard -20)</em> per hour or suffer 1d10 E damage (cold, reduced by cold-weather gear). Blizzards (30% chance per hour): visibility 5m, -30 to everything, <em>Navigate (Very Hard -30)</em> or lost at altitude — being lost here means <em>Toughness (Hard -20)</em> per hour or 2d10 E damage. <em>Survival (Hard -20)</em> to establish camp safely. <em>Tech-Use (Challenging +0)</em> to maintain vox contact with base (the altitude and warp interference degrade signals rapidly). 2 CP per hour above 3000m — the immaterium bleeds through more easily at altitude, where the barrier between realspace and the warp grows thin as the air itself.</p>\n<p>The passes are also patrolled by degraded xenos constructs — Vault Guardians still functioning on ancient power cells, their original purpose (containment enforcement) long since corrupted into simple territorial aggression. They fire on anything that moves. Their las-weapons are archaic but functional, and their force-field generators still flicker intermittently. The Acolytes should not attempt this route unprepared. Adequate cold-weather gear, sufficient rations (minimum 3 days' supply), and ideally a guide (Kasimir provides +20 to Navigate) are essential. Without preparation, the mountain passes will kill the party before the Vault's inhabitants get the chance.</p>\n\n<h3>6. To the Warp Nexus — Cross-Country</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Distance</strong></td><td>1 segment from the Distillery, 2 from Vallak (~4–8 hours)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Terrain</strong></td><td>Corrupted woodland, hills, no path</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk Level</strong></td><td>Dangerous — warp corruption intensifies as you approach</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Navigation</strong></td><td><em>Navigate (Challenging +0)</em> required, no road</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>There is no road to the Warp Nexus. There never was. The xenos standing stones predate human settlement on Barovus by millennia, and no sane Imperial planner would build a road to a site of concentrated warp energy. The route is cross-country — through forest that grows increasingly wrong as the Nexus approaches. The trees lean toward the stones. Their bark is grey and smooth, like skin. Their branches move without wind. The undergrowth rustles with things that are not animals.</p>\n<p>Navigation is required every hour — the landscape shifts subtly, and compass readings become unreliable within 2 kilometres of the stones (the warp energy interferes with magnetic instruments). <em>Psyniscience</em> becomes increasingly useful as the Nexus approaches — the psychic resonance grows from a whisper to a roar, and a psyker can follow it like a beacon. Non-psykers must rely on landmarks, and the landmarks have a tendency to move. 1 CP per hour of travel in the corrupted woodland. The warp-fog here is not passive — it reaches, tugs, and whispers. It knows your name.</p>\n\n<h3>7. To the Fallen Astartes Outpost — The Overgrown Road</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Distance</strong></td><td>2 segments (~8–12 hours from Fortress Vallak)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Terrain</strong></td><td>Secondary Imperial road, heavily overgrown</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk Level</strong></td><td>Tense, escalating to Dangerous — increasingly haunted</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Navigation</strong></td><td><em>Navigate (Challenging +0)</em> — road exists but is obscured</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>A secondary Imperial road once connected Fortress Vallak to the Silver Drakes' forward observation post. It was a military road — wider than necessary, reinforced for heavy vehicle traffic, with defensive positions built into the verges at regular intervals. The Silver Drakes are centuries gone, and their road has been reclaimed by the forest with a thoroughness that suggests intent rather than neglect. Trees have grown through the rockcrete surface. Roots have lifted entire slabs. The defensive positions are overgrown mounds, barely recognisable as foxholes and gun emplacements.</p>\n<p>The road has an atmosphere that is distinct from any other route on Barovus. It is not the oppressive dread of the main road, nor the hostile corruption of the Nexus approach. It is <em>sorrow</em>. A heavy, pervasive melancholy that settles on the chest and thickens with every step. <em>Psyniscience (Ordinary +10)</em> identifies it as psychic residue — the emotional imprint of a Chapter that knew it was dying and kept fighting anyway. <em>Willpower (Ordinary +10)</em> per hour or suffer 1 IP from the weight of accumulated grief. As the outpost approaches, Acolytes may hear fragments of vox-transmissions — ghost signals on frequencies that the Silver Drakes used centuries ago. The transmissions are not recordings. They are echoes. The dead Astartes are still broadcasting, still reporting, still holding the line in whatever afterlife the warp has trapped them in.</p>\n\n<h3>8. To Zarovich Spire — The Spire Road</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Distance</strong></td><td>1 segment (~3–4 hours from Fortress Vallak)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Terrain</strong></td><td>Well-maintained Imperial road, ascending</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk Level</strong></td><td>Tranquil (physically) / Catastrophic (psychologically)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Navigation</strong></td><td>None required — the road is unmistakable</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The Spire Road is the only well-maintained route on Barovus, and it is maintained by Strahd's own servitors — mechanical constructs that emerge at night to fill potholes, clear debris, and replace the road's distinctive illumination: skull-lanterns. Every fifty metres, a human skull mounted on a wrought-iron post, its eye sockets fitted with perpetual-glow lumen beads that cast a cold blue light across the road's surface. The skulls are real. The light they cast is adequate. The effect is exactly as intimidating as Strahd intends.</p>\n<p>Nothing attacks on the Spire Road. Not wolves, not mutants, not plague revenants, not daemons. Nothing. The Random Encounter Table is suspended entirely on this route. This is Strahd's road, and his authority here is absolute. The creatures of Barovus understand this instinctively — they do not hunt on the Spire Road because to do so would be to challenge the Lord-Governor's sovereignty, and nothing on this world is that foolish.</p>\n<p>The safety is the horror. The Acolytes walk for three hours on a perfect road, well-lit, unmolested, through a world that has tried to kill them every other moment of every other day — and the reason they are safe is that a monster has claimed this path as his own. The road ascends steadily toward the Spire, which is visible from the moment of departure: a black needle against the grey sky, growing larger with each step, its silhouette wrong in ways that become apparent only gradually (the towers are too tall, the angles are too sharp, the structure defies architectural logic in a manner that suggests warp-influence on the construction itself).</p>\n<p>The psychological toll is the point. <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> upon reaching the Spire gates or gain 1d5 IP — not from danger, but from the dawning realisation that you have walked willingly into the lair of the most powerful entity on the planet, along a road he built specifically for this purpose, and he has been watching you approach for three hours without lifting a finger to stop you because he <em>wants</em> you here.</p>"

This encounter guide covers the eight major encounter areas that the Game Master should deploy during overworld travel. These areas are not tied to specific map locations but to travel conditions: the type of road, the time of day, the density of the fog, and the whims of the Lord-Governor. Use them to fill travel segments with tension, discovery, and the grinding attrition that defines movement across this cursed world.</p>\n\n<h3>Main Road (Barovus to Vallak)</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Warp-fog density varies along the main road. Roll 1d10 per travel segment: 1–3 light fog (no mechanical effect, visibility adequate), 4–6 medium fog (-10 to Perception tests, visibility 30m), 7–9 thick fog (-20 to Perception tests, +1 CP per hour, visibility 10m), 10 impenetrable fog (lost — trigger \"Lost in the Mists,\" see Area 7 below). The fog does not transition gradually. It thickens in an instant, as though a door has closed. One moment the road stretches ahead, grey and miserable but visible. The next, the Acolyte in front of you is a silhouette, and the one behind you is gone.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Road markers appear every kilometre — stone pillars with distance measurements, directional arrows, and prayer inscriptions in faded High Gothic. One marker per hour of travel. <em>Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) (Ordinary +10)</em> to read the prayers. The sequence tells a story: faith degrading in real time, carved into stone by Ministorum-trained hands that were losing their grip on belief. The first marker near Barovus reads <em>\"The Emperor Protects.\"</em> Subsequent markers: <em>\"The Emperor Watches.\" \"The Emperor Remembers.\" \"The Emperor Endures.\" \"Endure.\" \"Endure.\" \"HOPE IS A LIE. ENDURE.\"</em> The final marker before Fortress Vallak has been defaced — the prayer scratched out and replaced with a single word in a different hand: <em>\"RUN.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP per hour in thick fog. 1 IP from reading the complete prayer sequence — watching faith die one stone pillar at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Set the tone for all travel with this route. The main road is the most-used corridor in the campaign and should never feel routine. Vary the fog density, use the road markers as environmental storytelling, and remember that the road is haunted not by specific entities but by atmosphere. The silence between encounters is the encounter. Every crackle of static on the vox, every shape half-seen in the fog, every moment the Acolytes spend wondering if the shadow ahead is a tree or something else — that is the road doing its work.</p>\n\n<h3>Mountain Road (Vallak to Krezk)</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Skill Challenge</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Ascending altitude with real mechanical consequences. After hour 3: <em>Toughness (Challenging +0)</em> per hour or suffer 1d10 E damage (cold, reduced by cold-weather gear). Visibility decreases with altitude. Wind increases — ranged attacks at -10 above the treeline, -20 during gusts. Switchbacks and exposed cliff-edge paths: <em>Agility (Challenging +0)</em> during high wind or risk being blown toward a drop (a second <em>Agility (Hard -20)</em> Test to catch oneself, or 3d10+5 I damage from a fall). The guard posts at intervals are empty shells — abandoned decades or centuries ago, their doors hanging open, their interiors stripped of anything useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> <em>Navigate (Challenging +0)</em> at each fork in the road — the route splits multiple times, and the signage is gone. Some forks lead to dead ends against cliff faces. Some lead to precipices that drop into fog. One fork leads to an abandoned guard post containing a single, intact vox-unit that plays a looping recording: a PDF sergeant's voice, calm and professional, reporting that all roads to Krezk are closed due to \"environmental hazard\" — a recording three centuries old, still playing to an audience of nobody. <em>Survival (Hard -20)</em> to locate emergency shelter if weather turns severe — a cave, an overhang, a guard post with enough roof remaining to block the wind.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Warp-wolf pack (50% chance per hour after hour 4). 4 Warp-Wolves — use Warp-Mutant profile with +10 Ag and Pack Tactics (wolves that successfully hit the same target in the same round inflict an additional 1d10 R damage from coordinated tearing). The wolves at altitude are desperate — they do not break off when wounded. They fight to the death or until every wolf is down. <strong>Scaling:</strong> For 3 Acolytes, reduce to 3 wolves. For 6+, add 2 wolves and a pack alpha (double Wounds, Fear 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP per hour above the treeline (warp exposure at altitude — the barrier thins where the air thins). 1 IP from the first clear view of the warp-fog boundary — the prison walls of Barovus, visible and absolute.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The mountain road is an attrition encounter. Cold damage, Fatigue, and wolf attacks grind the party down before they ever reach Krezk. The guard posts should feel like archaeological evidence of a functional Imperial world that no longer exists — each one a snapshot of normalcy preserved in decay. The vox recording in the dead-end guard post is a particular gut-punch: a man doing his duty, reporting to command, unaware that command stopped listening three centuries ago. Let the players sit with that.</p>\n\n<h3>Vineyard Road (Vallak to Distillery)</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tranquil/Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Discovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Vostra caravans (50% chance of encounter on this route). They are friendly here — this is their territory, their supply line, and they are comfortable. They share news from Fortress Vallak and the distillery, trade supplies at fair-ish prices, and offer escort for the final stretch. <em>Charm (Ordinary +10)</em> to establish genuine rapport — the Vostra on the Vineyard Road are less guarded than those encountered elsewhere, more willing to gossip, more likely to share a flask of recaf and a story. They know things. They always know things.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The cultivated fields flanking the road are barely functional but stubbornly alive. Terrified farmers tend thin recaf crops in fields that should not support growth. <em>Survival (Ordinary +10)</em> reveals the anomaly: the soil near the recaf plants is measurably less warp-saturated than the surrounding earth. The plants are purifying the ground. <em>Psyniscience (Challenging +0)</em> confirms a faint anti-corruption field radiating from the direction of the distillery — the sacred seeds' influence, extending across the vineyard like a blessing soaked into the earth.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> No CP on this route under normal conditions — the sacred seeds' influence provides a buffer. This is the only route on Barovus where this is true. 0 IP unless something disrupts the journey.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The safest road in the campaign. Use it for social encounters, resupply, and a false sense of security. The absence of danger is itself unsettling — after days of constant threat, three hours of peace should feel wrong. Something should feel wrong about how safe it is. The farmers wave but do not speak. The Vostra are friendly but leave before dusk. The wolves do not howl here. The silence is not threatening — it is <em>held</em>, like a breath, like a courtesy extended by someone who could revoke it. Because someone could. Because someone is watching the Vineyard Road too, and the reason it is safe is not that Strahd cannot reach it. It is that Strahd has chosen not to.</p>\n\n<h3>Swamp Tracks (Vallak to Berez)</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Skill Challenge</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The road degrades from track to marsh across three distinct phases. <strong>Phase 1 (Hours 1–2):</strong> Deteriorating road — mud, standing water in ruts, increasingly poor footing. Manageable. <strong>Phase 2 (Hours 3–4):</strong> Knee-deep water. <em>Agility (Challenging +0, -10 for heavy armour)</em> each hour or fall prone in sucking mud. Leeches: <em>Toughness (Ordinary +10)</em> or 1d5 R damage (blood drain) per hour — the leeches are not warp-touched, merely enormous. <strong>Phase 3 (Hours 5+):</strong> Deep swamp. Toxic fumes: <em>Toughness (Hard -20)</em> per hour or 1 Fatigue (rebreathers negate). Visibility 15m. The water glows faintly phosphorescent green — warp residue from the catastrophe that created the swamp. Things move in the water. Not all of them are revenants.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> <em>Navigate (Hard -20)</em> required every hour after the road ends. Failure: 1d5 hours lost circling through identical reed beds and half-submerged ruins. The landscape repeats — the same broken wall, the same leaning watchtower, the same half-submerged ground-car skeleton. <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> to recognise this as warp-spatial distortion rather than genuine disorientation. Critical Navigate failure: led into quicksand — <em>Athletics (Hard -20)</em> to escape or sink. Sinking means suffocation after 3 rounds. Companions can assist: <em>Strength (Challenging +0)</em> with a rope or improvised aid.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP per hour in the swamp (the water is warp-saturated — the catastrophe soaked corruption into the groundwater permanently). 1 IP upon first encountering the phosphorescent glow — light should not come from beneath you, and the things silhouetted by that light should not have human shapes.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The swamp tracks are designed to exhaust the party before they reach Berez proper. Fatigue from toxic fumes, damage from leeches and cold water, and the constant drain of Navigation tests and CP accumulation create a war of attrition that mirrors the setting's themes. Nobody comes to Berez prepared enough. The swamp ensures it. Remind the players that turning back is always an option — and that the swamp is equally dangerous in both directions.</p>\n\n<h3>Mountain Passes (to the Empyrean Vault)</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Deadly</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Skill Challenge</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Lethal cold above 3000m. <em>Toughness (Hard -20)</em> per hour or suffer 1d10 E damage (cold, reduced by cold-weather gear — without gear, this damage is unavoidable and cumulative). Blizzards (30% chance per hour): visibility 5m, -30 to all tests, <em>Navigate (Very Hard -30)</em> or lost at altitude. Being lost above 3000m: <em>Toughness (Hard -20)</em> per hour or 2d10 E damage as wind chill and exposure strip heat from the body faster than the body can produce it. The cold is not natural — it is the cold of absence, as though heat itself has been consumed by something vast and hungry and patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Challenge:</strong> <em>Navigate (Very Hard -30)</em> to find the Vault entrance. Modifiers: -10 without prior intelligence about the location, +20 if Kasimir guides (he has studied the approach for decades). <em>Survival (Hard -20)</em> to establish camp safely — finding shelter above the treeline requires either luck or skill, and failing means sleeping exposed, which means another Toughness test against cold damage. <em>Tech-Use (Challenging +0)</em> to maintain vox contact with base — the altitude, atmospheric interference, and warp energy degrade signals to static within hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies:</strong> Vault Guardians — degraded xenos constructs still patrolling on ancient power cells. Use modified Combat Servitor profiles with archaic las-weapons and intermittent force-field generators (Protection Rating 30, but flickering — 50% chance of function per hit). They fire on anything that moves. They do not communicate. They do not negotiate. They are machines following orders given by a civilisation that died before humanity learned to use fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 2 CP per hour above 3000m. The warp bleeds through at altitude — the barrier between realspace and the immaterium is gossamer-thin here, and the whispers of bound entities in the Vault below can be heard as faint, persuasive murmurs on the wind. 1d5 IP from extended exposure (4+ hours) to the whispers — they are not random noise, they are tailored, addressing each Acolyte's specific fears and desires. <em>Willpower (Hard -20)</em> to recognise them as external rather than internal thoughts.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The mountain passes should feel like a survival expedition — a genre shift from gothic horror to arctic survival thriller. Supply management becomes critical: rations, cold-weather gear, stimms to fight Fatigue, medikits for cold damage. The passes are designed to make the Acolytes spend resources before they reach the Vault, ensuring they arrive depleted. This is intentional — the Vault's temptations are harder to resist when you are cold, tired, wounded, and desperate. Kasimir as a guide is nearly essential; without him, the Navigation tests are brutal. If the party insists on going alone, let them. The mountain will teach them.</p>\n\n<h3>The Black Carriage</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Tense</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Social, Environmental</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Social:</strong> Random event — 10% chance per road journey (roll once per complete trip between locations, not per segment). Strahd's personal transport materialises from the warp-fog: an ornate, antigrav groundcar of archaic design, jet black with silver filigree bearing the Zarovich crest, drawn by two massive augmetic horses with glowing red optical sensors. It glides silently out of the fog and stops before the party. The door opens. Inside: velvet-lined interior, temperature-controlled, comfortable in a way that nothing on Barovus is comfortable. A handwritten invitation on parchment rests on the seat, penned in Strahd's precise, elegant script.</p>\n<p>If accepted: the Acolyte (or Acolytes) are transported directly and instantly to the Zarovich Spire. Strahd receives them for dinner — courteous, erudite, terrifying in his hospitality. This is almost certainly a trap, but it is also the fastest route to the final confrontation, and the intelligence gathered at Strahd's table can be invaluable. If refused: the carriage follows the party for 1d5 hours before vanishing back into the fog, its augmetic horses keeping perfect pace, the open door a constant invitation at the edge of peripheral vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> While the carriage follows: <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> each hour or gain 1 CP — not from warp exposure, but from the compulsion to turn back and enter. The pull is not magical. It is psychological. The carriage represents warmth, safety, answers, an end to walking. The corruption comes from wanting those things badly enough to accept them from Strahd. While the carriage is present, all random encounters are suppressed — nothing attacks. Nothing approaches. The wolves retreat, the revenants sink beneath the water, the fog parts around the carriage's path. Strahd is demonstrating something: the danger on the roads exists because he <em>allows</em> it.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP per hour of carriage proximity. Accepting the ride: 2 CP (willing entry into Strahd's domain, on his terms, at his invitation — a moral compromise regardless of tactical justification). 1d5 IP from the dinner itself (Strahd's psychic presence at close range, sustained, for hours).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The Black Carriage is pure theatre. It is Strahd saying: <em>\"I can reach you anywhere, at any time, and offer you everything you need, and all it costs is your dignity.\"</em> The suppressed encounters are the real message — not that Strahd protects the Acolytes, but that the road's dangers are his to command. He turns them off like a light switch. The dinner, if accepted, should be roleplayed in full — Strahd is charming, attentive, and genuinely interested in the Acolytes. He shares real intelligence. He asks thoughtful questions. He is the best host the Acolytes have ever met, and that is the horror. Reference Interrogator Vasek's confession from Berez: <em>\"He went to dinner. And when he came back, he said we should study it further.\"</em></p>\n\n<h3>Lost in the Mists</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Catastrophic</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Faith Test</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Triggered by: critical Navigate failure, impenetrable warp-fog (1d10 roll of 10 on the main road), or Strahd's direct intervention (he can push the Acolytes into the mists as punishment or amusement). The party is lost — not delayed, not off-course, but <em>lost</em> in the warp-fog of Barovus, where direction is meaningless and time is negotiable.</p>\n<p>Time dilates. What feels like hours may be days. What feels like days may be minutes. Clocks disagree with each other. The sun does not move. The fog is not passive — it has intent, or something very like it. Navigate tests are meaningless inside the mists; the fog does not respond to skill, only to will. Reality degrades progressively: sounds from nowhere (footsteps behind that stop when you stop, voices calling names the Acolytes have not spoken aloud), shapes in the fog (humanoid, always at the edge of visibility, always moving away), and whispers of dead friends (if any Acolytes have died during the campaign, they hear those voices — warm, concerned, asking them to follow).</p>\n<p><strong>Faith Test:</strong> Escape requires a <em>Willpower (Very Hard -30)</em> group test — one success is sufficient. Prayer adds +10 (the Emperor's light is dim on Barovus but it is not gone, and the mists are not yet strong enough to silence it entirely). Litany of Protection adds +20 but must be recited correctly: <em>Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) (Challenging +0)</em> under extreme duress. <strong>On failure:</strong> 1d10 CP + 1d10 IP, and the party emerges 1d5 days later at a random location (roll 1d8: 1 — Village of Barovus, 2 — Fortress Vallak outskirts, 3 — Vineyard Road, 4 — swamp edge near Berez, 5 — forest near Astartes Outpost, 6 — mountain foothills, 7 — Warp Nexus perimeter, 8 — base of the Spire Road). Rations consumed for lost days. <strong>On critical failure:</strong> one party member (randomly determined) experiences a temporal displacement — they live a fragment of Strahd's memory as though it were their own. They feel what he felt. They see through his eyes. They understand, for a brief and terrible moment, why he made his choices. 1d10 CP + 2d10 IP, but the displaced Acolyte gains a genuine clue about Strahd's weakness (GM's choice — the location of an artifact, a vulnerability in the Spire's defences, or a detail about the pact that can be exploited).</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> Minimum 1d5 CP from exposure to the raw warp-stuff of the mists. IP and additional CP from the experience as described above. Even a successful escape costs: the mists leave a residue on the soul that does not wash off.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> \"Lost in the Mists\" is the ultimate environmental threat on Barovus. Use it sparingly — once or twice in the entire campaign, maximum. It should feel like the world itself has turned hostile, like the ground has opened beneath the Acolytes and dropped them into something that is not a place but a <em>state</em>. The escape mechanic is deliberately simple (one WP test, group, one success needed) because the point is the experience, not the puzzle. The mists are not a challenge to be solved. They are a horror to be survived. The temporal displacement on critical failure is the campaign's most aggressive narrative tool — use it to deliver crucial intelligence at maximum psychological cost. The Acolyte who lives Strahd's memory will never see him the same way again. That is the point.</p>\n\n<h3>Night Travel</h3>\n<table><tbody>\n<tr><td><strong>Risk</strong></td><td>Dangerous</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>Environmental, Combat</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental:</strong> Barovus at night is <em>active</em>. The warp-fog thickens to near-opacity. All warp-touched creatures gain +10 to combat characteristics. The witching hour (02:00–04:00 local) is the apex: warp-fog at maximum density, all Perception tests at -20, Corruption and Insanity tests at -10, and things move at the edge of vision that are not wholly there — shapes that exist in the space between realspace and the immaterium, visible only in peripheral vision, gone when looked at directly. <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> each hour of night travel or gain 1 IP — not from any specific horror, but from the sustained, grinding terror of walking through absolute darkness on a road you cannot see, surrounded by things you cannot identify, toward a destination you may never reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Encounter chance is doubled during night travel (roll twice per segment on the Random Encounter Table, add +20 to each roll). Most likely encounters during night travel — roll 1d10: 1–4 Warp-Wolf pack (4–6 wolves, +10 to all characteristics from nighttime bonus, glowing violet eyes visible before anything else), 5–7 Plague Revenants (2–4, shambling from the treeline or rising from roadside ditches where they lay dormant during the day), 8–9 Warp-Mutant stalker (a lone, intelligent mutant that has been tracking the party since dusk — <em>Awareness (Hard -20)</em> to detect before it strikes), 10 Strahd himself (observing from the fog, not attacking, his eyes the only thing visible — two points of cold light in the darkness, watching, always watching). <strong>Scaling:</strong> Standard per-encounter scaling applies. Night combat imposes -10 to BS (darkness) unless the Acolytes have illumination, which reveals their position to everything within line of sight.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Night travel reveals things invisible by day. The standing stones of the Warp Nexus emit a visible warp-glow (pale violet, pulsing in rhythm with an unseen heartbeat) that can be seen from the main road on clear nights — a useful navigation aid and a deeply unsettling one. Ghost-lights appear in the forest: will-o-wisps of concentrated warp energy that bob and weave between the trees, leading toward either danger (50% — a revenant nest, a mutant den, a sinkhole) or discovery (50% — a supply cache, a hidden shrine, a lost data-slate). <em>Willpower (Challenging +0)</em> to resist following a ghost-light; <em>Psyniscience (Hard -20)</em> to determine its nature before following. Most critically, the true shape of the warp-fog boundary is visible at night — a solid wall of writhing, luminescent mist at the world's edge, stretching from ground to sky, casting its own sickly light across the landscape. It is not fog. It is a barrier. It is a cage. Seeing it clearly for the first time costs 1d5 IP.</p>\n<p><strong>Corruption/Insanity:</strong> 1 CP per hour of night travel (ambient warp exposure, heightened at night). 1 IP per combat encounter (violence in darkness, against things that should not exist, is qualitatively worse than the same violence by day). 1d5 IP from a clear view of the warp-fog boundary (first time only).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> Night travel should be discouraged but never forbidden. Sometimes the party <em>must</em> travel at night — because a deadline demands it, because they are being pursued, because a quest objective requires it. When they do, make it memorable. The witching hour phenomena should escalate — do not front-load the horror. Start with silence and fog. Add sounds. Add shapes. Add the feeling of being watched. Add the certainty that something is pacing them just beyond the light. Build it layer by layer until the players are genuinely tense, and then — only then — spring the combat encounter. The silence afterward, when the bodies are cooling and the road stretches on into nothing, is the real horror. Let them walk in that silence. Let them hear their own breathing and the crunch of their boots and nothing else, for a very long time, before the next sound comes.</p>"
