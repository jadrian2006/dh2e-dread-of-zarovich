The vessel is broadcasting a repeating distress signal on Imperial frequencies. The signal is approximately <span class=\"vox-redacted\">REDACTED</span> years old.</p><p>Warp Anomaly Theta-VII-Sigma has been flagged by the Ordo Malleus as a region of persistent reality instability. Previous expeditions into the anomaly's periphery have reported temporal displacement, psychic interference, and the loss of three survey craft.</p><p>Your mission parameters are as follows:</p><p>1. Board the derelict vessel and determine its origin, crew status, and cargo.</p><p>2. Assess the nature and source of the warp anomaly.</p><p>3. Recover any intelligence assets, artifacts, or specimens of value to the Ordo.</p><p>4. Eliminate any hostile entities encountered.</p><p>5. Report findings via astropathic relay upon completion.</p><p>Your vessel, the Dawn's Reproach, will maintain position at the anomaly's edge. Standard extraction protocols apply.</p><p>The Emperor protects.

No warp route out. No astropathic contact. The Navigator is dead. Elisabeth says we must find our own path. She has been reading texts recovered from the lower cargo holds — volumes bound in leather that feels warm to the touch. She says there are powers that listen when the Emperor does not.</p><p>Year 11 — The rituals have begun in earnest. Elisabeth leads them. I confess I no longer resist. The sensations... the visions... they are beyond anything I have known. We have cleared the lower engineering decks. The crew do not ask questions. Those who do are given to the altar.</p><p>Year 14 — The children must not know. Rose suspects. She is too clever. Thorn is too young to understand why Mother and Father go below-decks at night. The sounds from engineering — Elisabeth says they are 'hymns.' I no longer know the difference between a hymn and a scream.</p><p>Year 15 — It is done. The thing fused with the warp drive is awake. Elisabeth says it is a gift from the Prince of Pleasure. I say it is our damnation. But I cannot look away. I cannot stop. None of us can stop.</p><p class=\"parchment-bloodstain\">The children are dead. We locked them in their cabin to keep them safe. We forgot. Emperor forgive us, we forgot them.</p></div><div class=\"parchment-signature\">Gustav Durst, Master of Durst's Lament</div></div>"

I sought power when the Emperor's light faded. The Prince answered. He always answers. The thing fused with the warp drive is my final gift to this vessel — it feeds on suffering, and this ship will never lack for that. Gustav is dead. He could not bear what we had become. The children — Emperor forgive me — I locked them away to spare them from what the rituals would do to their minds. I told myself I would return for them. I did not. The Prince whispered that their fear was sweeter than any offering I could carve from flesh.</p><p>Do not go to the lower decks. But you will. The ship will make sure of it. It is too late for us.

He retreats to his coffin in the Spire's crypts when critically wounded.</p><p>5. The 'Heart of Sorrow' — a warp crystal in the Spire's upper levels — anchors his immortality. Destroy it first.</p><p>CONDITIONS FOR PERMANENT DESTRUCTION:</p><p>1. The Heart of Sorrow must be destroyed.</p><p>2. His coffin must be destroyed.</p><p>3. The killing blow must be struck with Dawn's Edge while the Rosette of Saint Markovia is active within proximity.</p><p>All three conditions must be met simultaneously. Failure on any point allows him to regenerate.</p><p class=\"vox-corrupt\">I have spent 27 years preparing. I am too old and too damaged to wield the blade myself.
