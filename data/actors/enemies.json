They hunt in packs through the forests and ruins of Barovus, communicating in guttural barks and howls.\n\nWarp-Mutants were once people — farmers, labourers, soldiers — who wandered too deep into the mists or lived too long near a warp nexus. The transformation is slow and agonizing, stripping away higher cognition while enhancing strength, speed, and predatory instinct. By the time the change is complete, nothing human remains.\n\nThey are the werewolves of Barovus — savage pack hunters that terrorize the roads between settlements. They are most active at night, when the warp-fog thickens and their mutations strengthen."

Unlike the malfunctioning servitors that wander Barovus, these are purpose-built killing machines maintained by Strahd's artificers. They stand dormant in alcoves — twelve in the audience chamber alone — until activated by sitting on the throne or Strahd's command.\n\nWhen activated, they advance with methodical brutality: lascarbine fire at range, power maul strikes in melee. They have no tactics, no self-preservation instinct, and no hesitation. They simply advance and strike until their targets stop moving."
