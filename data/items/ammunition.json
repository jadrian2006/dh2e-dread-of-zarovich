The casing bears a faint golden sheen that intensifies near warp phenomena, and the propellant smells faintly of sanctified incense rather than cordite.</p><p>Blessed by a sanctioned Ministorum priest — Father Donavich, the spirit of Sergei, or recovered from Inquisitor Van Richten's dwindling cache or the Fallen Astartes Outpost armory. Each blessing covers a single magazine; the infrastructure for mass-production does not exist on Barovus.</p><p><strong>Holy/Blessed ammunition.</strong> Counts as sanctified for all purposes. On hit against a warp-touched entity, <strong>negates the target's Regeneration trait for 1 full round.</strong> Multiple hits in the same round do not extend the duration — it resets from the most recent hit. <em>Availability: Extremely Rare.</em></p><p>Only 8 rounds in this magazine. Each one is irreplaceable. Do not waste them on lesser threats — save them for the moment Strahd's Regeneration needs to stop.</p>",

The silver has a tarnished, bluish quality, and close inspection reveals faint tool-marks where reliquary fixtures were melted down and recast into killing implements.</p><p>The silver itself was sourced from Ecclesiarchy reliquary fittings — candlesticks, chalice rims, icon frames — melted down by the Martikov family or resourceful Acolytes. Blasphemy in the eyes of the Ministorum, pragmatism in the eyes of survivors. The Martikovs can provide enough for 2-3 clips if the Acolytes earn their trust.</p><p><strong>Silvered ammunition.</strong> Effective against Warp-Mutants: <strong>+2 damage</strong> per hit. Silver disrupts certain warp-bonds, causing intense pain — struck Warp-Mutants must pass a <strong>Willpower Test or disengage</strong> from melee. Also negates Regeneration on Warp-Thralls. Can be manufactured with a successful <strong>Trade (Armourer)</strong> test and access to a silver source. <em>Availability: Rare.</em></p><p>Thirty rounds sounds generous until the first Warp-Mutant pack charges your position. Prioritise aimed shots — every silver tip that misses is a reliquary that died for nothing.</p>",

No two rounds look quite the same, and none of them look trustworthy.</p><p>The mark of Barovus: a world where nothing is wasted because nothing is supplied. Every spent casing is a resource. Every quiet hour at a workbench is an investment in survival. The Vostra have been reloading rounds for centuries; for off-world Acolytes, it is a grim education in scarcity.</p><p><strong>Reloaded ammunition.</strong> Functions as standard ammunition with a critical flaw: <strong>10% jam chance per round fired</strong> (on a roll of 96-00, the weapon jams as if it had the <em>Unreliable</em> quality). Production rate: <strong>2d10 rounds per hour</strong> of work with a successful <strong>Trade (Armourer)</strong> test, basic tools, and raw materials. <em>Availability: Crafted.</em></p><p>Better than an empty magazine. Worse than anything else. Use reloaded rounds when you have no alternative, and clear your weapon's jam before the next thing tries to kill you.</p>",
