On 1–5: ignores Critical Damage entirely, continues fighting. Permanently destroyed only by fire damage, holy/blessed weapons, or head destruction (called shot to head dealing Critical Damage destroys automatically).\n\n• Shambling — May not Run. Always act last in Initiative order regardless of Ag.\n\n• Mindless — Immune to Fear, Pinning, psychic powers targeting the mind (Domination, etc.), and all Fellowship-based tests.\n\n• Toxic — Targets hit by attacks must pass Toughness test or suffer 1d10 additional damage ignoring armour as warp-infection spreads through tissue.\n\nTACTICS: Plague Revenants have no tactics. They advance toward the nearest living thing and attack. They do not use cover, retreat, or coordinate. Their danger is purely numerical — they absorb resources and ammunition while more dangerous threats close in. Strahd sometimes herds them as a distraction."

Bonus lost immediately when engaged mutants drop.\n\n• Bestial — Immune to Fear and Pinning. Cannot use ranged weapons, read, or perform complex tasks.\n\n• Silver Vulnerability — Take +2 damage from silver weapons. Wounds from silver cause searing pain — mutant must pass WP test or Disengage next turn.\n\nTACTICS: Warp-Mutants use pack ambush tactics. They circle prey at a distance, howling to unnerve, then attack simultaneously from multiple directions to maximize Pack Tactics bonuses. They target stragglers and isolated individuals.

They detach from their perches with terrible speed for something made of solid rock, swooping down on bat-like stone wings to slam into targets with bone-crushing force.\n\nFlying movement: 6/12/18/36.\n\nTHREAT RATING: Challenging\n\nMOVEMENT: Half 2, Full 4, Charge 6, Run 12\n\nTRAITS: Fear (1), Dark Sight, Unnatural Strength (x2), Unnatural Toughness (x2), Size (Hulking), Flyer (6), Machine (4).\n\nSPECIAL RULES:\n\n• Dormant — Appear as ordinary stone statues until activated. Activated by Strahd (Free Action, anywhere in Spire), proximity triggers (unauthorized person within 5m), or specific programmed conditions. Detecting a dormant Gargoyle requires Hard (–20) Awareness or Scrutiny test.\n\n• Machine (4) — Reduces all incoming damage by 4 (in addition to armour). Immune to Toxic, Fatigue, Stunning, and all mind-affecting abilities.\n\n• Swooping Attack — When charging while flying, adds +2d10 damage to Slam attack instead of normal +1d10 charge bonus.\n\nTACTICS: Gargoyle-Servitors have limited intelligence — they follow simple programmed instructions. Typical behaviour: remain dormant until triggered, swoop to engage nearest target, slam repeatedly until target is destroyed, return to perch. They do not pursue fleeing targets beyond their assigned area. Strahd can override programming to direct them specifically."

Mundane weapons (without Blessed, Holy, Force, or Warp Weapon quality) deal minimum damage — all dice count as 1s.\n\n• Warp Weapon (Claws) — Claws count as Warp Weapons and ignore non-warded armour entirely.\n\n• Warp Instability — If the daemon fails a Willpower test (forced by psychic powers, holy weapon damage, or sanctified effects), roll on the Warp Instability table. Minor results: flickers, loses next turn. Major results: banished entirely, dissolving into warp-smoke.\n\nTACTICS: Lesser daemons are cunning but not strategic. They ambush isolated targets, flee from groups wielding blessed weapons, and prioritise vulnerable targets (wounded, fearful, low WP). They phase in and out of visibility, striking from shadows.

Gain +30 to Awareness and Tracking tests when following a psychic trail. A psyker using active powers within 500m draws all nearby packs.\n\n• Pack Coordination — When 4 or more Warp-Hounds attack a single target, one Hound may make a free Trip attempt (opposed Agility test) at the start of the round. Success knocks target Prone; all Hound attacks that round gain +10 WS.\n\nTACTICS: Warp-Hounds are patient hunters. They shadow prey for hours, waiting for exhaustion or isolation. They attack at night, targeting the most psychically active member of the party. If Ireena is present, she draws them irresistibly. They hit fast — Trip attempt to knock prone, then swarm. They retreat if more than half the pack is killed, but return with reinforcements within 1d5 hours."

Individual Mongrelfolk vary — roll within ranges: WS 20–35, BS 15–25, S 25–40, T 30–40, Ag 20–35, Int 15–30, Per 25–40, WP 20–30, Fel 5–15. Wounds 8–15.\n\nTHREAT RATING: Minion (Routine to Ordinary)\n\nMOVEMENT: Half 3, Full 6, Charge 9, Run 18\n\nTRAITS: Warp-Touched, Disturbing.\n\nSPECIAL RULES:\n\n• Disturbing — Characters encountering Mongrelfolk for the first time must pass Routine (+20) WP test or suffer –5 to Fellowship tests in their presence for the encounter duration. Not Fear — discomfort and pity.\n\n• Unique Mutations/Augments — Each Mongrelfolk has 1d3 unique mutations. Roll d10 per mutation:\n  1: Extra arm — one additional melee attack/round at –10 WS\n  2: Telescopic eye — +20 Per for ranged visual tests\n  3: Built-in vox — relay messages up to 2km\n  4: Enhanced smell — +20 Awareness when scent-relevant; track by smell\n  5: Reinforced skeleton — +2 AP body, +2 Wounds\n  6: Toxic spit — ranged 5m, 1d5 damage; Toughness test or Blinded 1 round\n  7: Wall-crawling — scale vertical surfaces at half movement, no test\n  8: Warp-sight — see warp entities/psychic auras, +10 Psyniscience untrained\n  9: Redundant organs — ignore first Critical Damage result\n  10: Mechanical voice box — perfectly mimic any voice/sound heard in last 24 hours\n\n• Compliance Device — Implanted control device. Abaron issues commands via device (Free Action). Removing the device requires Hard (–20) Medicae test; removal inflicts 1d10 damage but frees the Mongrelfolk.\n\nTACTICS: Mongrelfolk fight poorly and reluctantly. They mob targets on Abaron's command but break easily if he is killed or incapacitated. They are most dangerous in numbers (Abaron can direct up to 6 at once). Treat them as environmental obstacles during the Krezk encounter rather than genuine threats — the moral dimension is far more important than the combat."

Immune to Toxic, Fatigue, Stunning, and all mind-affecting abilities.\n\n• Fearless — Immune to Fear and Pinning. Cannot be intimidated or routed.\n\n• Dormant Activation — Activated by sitting on the audience chamber throne, Strahd's command, or specific security triggers. 12 total in the audience chamber.\n\n• No Tactics — Servitor-Guards have no self-preservation instinct. They advance toward the nearest designated target and attack. They do not use cover, retreat, or coordinate beyond basic spacing. Their threat is in their numbers, durability, and the tight quarters of the Spire.\n\nTACTICS: Pure attrition. They fire lascarbines on approach, then switch to power mauls in melee. They spread to engage as many targets as possible. Used best as a tide that forces the Acolytes to expend ammunition and resources before facing Strahd himself. The audience chamber fight (12 servitors in an enclosed space) should feel like a desperate, resource-draining slog."
